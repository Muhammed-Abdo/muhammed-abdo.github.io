Any board-room sitter with a taste for Wall Street lore has heard of<br/>the retort that J. P. Morgan the Elder is supposed to have made to a naïve acquaintance who had<br/>ventured to ask the great man what the market was going to do. “It will fluctuate,” replied Morgan<br/>dryly. And it has many other distinctive characteristics. Apart from the economic advantages and<br/>disadvantages of stock exchanges—the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance<br/>industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way<br/>for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money—their development has created a<br/>whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to<br/>given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown<br/>following the establishment, in 1611, of the world’s first important stock exchange—a roofless<br/>courtyard in Amsterdam—and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the New<br/>York Stock Exchange in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day stock trading in the United States—a<br/>bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that<br/>can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million<br/>stockholder participants—would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth-century Dutchmen<br/>haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was,<br/>inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New<br/>York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species’ self-<br/>understanding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5"><span>The behavior of the pioneering Dutch stock traders is ably documented in a book entitled<br/>“Confusion of Confusions,” written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named Joseph de la Vega;<br/>originally published in 1688, it was reprinted in English translation a few years ago by the Harvard<br/>Business School. As for the behavior of present-day American investors and brokers—whose traits,<br/>like those of all stock traders, are exaggerated in times of crisis—it may be clearly revealed through a<br/>consideration of their activities during the last week of May, 1962, a time when the stock market<br/>fluctuated in a startling way. On Monday, May 28th, the Dow-Jones average of thirty leading<br/>industrial stocks, which has been computed every trading day since 1897, dropped 34.95 points, or<br/>more than it had dropped on any other day except October 28, 1929, when the loss was 38.33 points.<br/>The volume of trading on May 28th was 9,350,000 shares—the seventh-largest one-day turnover in<br/>Stock Exchange history. On Tuesday, May 29th, after an alarming morning when most stocks sank far<br/>below their Monday-afternoon closing prices, the market suddenly changed direction, charged<br/>upward with astonishing vigor, and finished the day with a large, though not record-breaking, Dow-<br/>Jones gain of 27.03 points. Tuesday’s record, or near record, was in trading volume; the 14,750,000</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>shares that changed hands added up to the greatest one-day total ever except for October 29, 1929,<br/>when trading ran just over sixteen million shares. (Later in the sixties, ten, twelve, and even fourteen-<br/>million share days became commonplace; the 1929 volume record was finally broken on April 1st,<br/>1968, and fresh records were set again and again in the next few months.) Then, on Thursday, May<br/>31st, after a Wednesday holiday in observance of Memorial Day, the cycle was completed; on a<br/>volume of 10,710,000 shares, the fifth-greatest in history, the Dow-Jones average gained 9.40 points,<br/>leaving it slightly above the level where it had been before all the excitement began.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark6"><span>The crisis ran its course in three days, but, needless to say, the post-mortems took longer. One of<br/>de la Vega’s observations about the Amsterdam traders was that they were “very clever in inventing<br/>reasons” for a sudden rise or fall in stock prices, and the Wall Street pundits certainly needed all the<br/>cleverness they could muster to explain why, in the middle of an excellent business year, the market<br/>had suddenly taken its second-worst nose dive ever up to that moment. Beyond these explanations—<br/>among which President Kennedy’s April crackdown on the steel industry’s planned price increase<br/>ranked high—it was inevitable that the postmortems should often compare May, 1962, with October,<br/>1929. The figures for price movement and trading volume alone would have forced the parallel, even<br/>if the worst panic days of the two months—the twenty-eighth and the twenty-ninth—had not<br/>mysteriously and, to some people, ominously coincided. But it was generally conceded that the<br/>contrasts were more persuasive than the similarities. Between 1929 and 1962, regulation of trading<br/>practices and limitations on the amount of credit extended to customers for the purchase of stock had<br/>made it difficult, if not actually impossible, for a man to lose </span></a><i>all </i><span>his money on the Exchange. In short,<br/>de la Vega’s epithet for the Amsterdam stock exchange in the sixteen-eighties—he called it “this<br/>gambling hell,” although he obviously loved it—had become considerably less applicable to the New<br/>York exchange in the thirty-three years between the two crashes.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE <span class="p">1962 crash did not come without warning, even though few observers read the warnings<br/>correctly. Shortly after the beginning of the year, stocks had begun falling at a pretty consistent rate,<br/>and the pace had accelerated to the point where the previous business week—that of May 21st<br/>through May 25th—had been the worst on the Stock Exchange since June, 1950. On the morning of<br/>Monday, May 28th, then, brokers and dealers had reason to be in a thoughtful mood. Had the bottom<br/>been reached, or was it still ahead? Opinion appears, in retrospect, to have been divided. The Dow-<br/>Jones news service, which sends its subscribers spot financial news by teleprinter, reflected a certain<br/>apprehensiveness between the time it started its transmissions, at nine o’clock, and the opening of the<br/>Stock Exchange, at ten. During this hour, the broad tape (as the Dow-Jones service, which is printed<br/>on vertically running paper six and a quarter inches wide, is often called, to distinguish it from the<br/>Stock Exchange price tape, which is printed horizontally and is only three-quarters of an inch high)<br/>commented that many securities dealers had been busy over the weekend sending out demands for<br/>additional collateral to credit customers whose stock assets were shrinking in value; remarked that<br/>the   type of precipitate liquidation seen during the previous week “has been a stranger to Wall Street<br/>for years;” and went on to give several items of encouraging business news, such as the fact that<br/>Westinghouse had just received a new Navy contract. In the stock market, however, as de la Vega<br/>points      out, “the news [as such] is often of little value;” in the short run, the mood of the investors is<br/>what counts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark7"><span>This mood became manifest within a matter of minutes after the Stock Exchange opened. At 10:11,<br/>the  broad tape reported that “stocks at the opening were mixed and only moderately active.” This was<br/>reassuring information, because “mixed” meant that some were up and some were down, and also</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>because a falling market is universally regarded as far less threatening when the amount of activity in<br/>it is moderate rather than great. But the comfort was short-lived, for by 10:30 the Stock Exchange<br/>tape, which records the price and the share volume of every transaction made on the floor, not only<br/>was consistently recording lower prices but, running at its maximum speed of five hundred characters<br/>per minute, was six minutes late. The lateness of the tape meant that the machine was simply unable to<br/>keep abreast of what was going on, so fast were trades being made. Normally, when a transaction is<br/>completed on the floor of the Exchange, at 11 Wall Street, an Exchange employee writes the details<br/>on a slip of paper and sends it by pneumatic tube to a room on the fifth floor of the building, where<br/>one of a staff of girls types it into the ticker machine for transmission. A lapse of two or three minutes<br/>between a floor transaction and its appearance on the tape is normal, therefore, and is not considered<br/>by the Stock Exchange to be “lateness;” that word, in the language of the Exchange, is used only to<br/>describe any additional lapse between the time a sales slip arrives on the fifth floor and the time the<br/>hard-pressed ticker is able to accommodate it. (“The terms used on the Exchange are not carefully<br/>chosen,” complained de la Vega.) Tape delays of a few minutes occur fairly often on busy trading<br/>days, but since 1930, when the type of ticker in use in 1962 was installed, big delays had been<br/>extremely rare. On October 24, 1929, when the tape fell two hundred and forty-six minutes behind, it<br/>was being printed at the rate of two hundred and eighty-five characters a minute; before May, 1962,<br/>the greatest delay that had ever occurred on the new machine was thirty-four minutes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark8"><span>Unmistakably, prices were going down and activity was going up, but the situation was still not<br/>desperate. All that had been established by eleven o’clock was that the previous week’s decline was<br/>continuing at a moderately accelerated rate. But as the pace of trading increased, so did the tape<br/>delay. At 10:55, it was thirteen minutes late; at 11:14, twenty minutes; at 11:35, twenty-eight minutes;<br/>at 11:58, thirty-eight minutes; and at 12:14, forty-three minutes. (To inject at least a seasoning of up-<br/>to-date information into the tape when it is five minutes or more in arrears, the Exchange periodically<br/>interrupted its normal progress to insert “flashes,” or current prices of a few leading stocks. The time<br/>required to do this, of course, added to the lateness.) The noon computation of the Dow-Jones<br/>industrial average showed a loss for the day so far of 9.86 points.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Signs of public hysteria began to appear during the lunch hour. One sign was the fact that between<br/>twelve and two, when the market is traditionally in the doldrums, not only did prices continue to<br/>decline but volume continued to rise, with a corresponding effect on the tape; just before two o’clock,<br/>the tape delay stood at fifty-two minutes. Evidence that people are selling stocks at a time when they<br/>ought to be eating lunch is always regarded as a serious matter. Perhaps just as convincing a portent<br/>of approaching agitation was to be found in the Times Square office (at 1451 Broadway) of Merrill<br/>Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, the undisputed Gargantua of the brokerage trade. This office was<br/>plagued by a peculiar problem: because of its excessively central location, it was visited every day at<br/>lunchtime by an unusual number of what are known in brokerage circles as “walk-ins”—people who<br/>are securities customers only in a minuscule way, if at all, but who find the atmosphere of a brokerage<br/>office and the changing prices on its quotation board entertaining, especially in times of stock-market<br/>crisis. (“Those playing the game merely for the sake of entertainment and not because of greediness<br/>are easily to be distinguished.”—de la Vega.) From long experience, the office manager, a calm<br/>Georgian named Samuel Mothner, had learned to recognize a close correlation between the current<br/>degree of public concern about the market and the number of walk-ins in his office, and at midday on<br/>May 28th the mob of them was so dense as to have, for his trained sensibilities, positively albatross-<br/>like connotations of disaster ahead.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mothner’s troubles, like those of brokers from San Diego to Bangor, were by no means confined to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark9"><span>disturbing signs and portents. An unrestrained liquidation of stocks was already well under way; in<br/>Mothner’s office, orders from customers were running five or six times above average, and nearly all<br/>of them were orders to sell. By and large, brokers were urging their customers to keep cool and hold<br/>on to their stocks, at least for the present, but many of the customers could not be persuaded. In<br/>another midtown Merrill Lynch office, at 61 West Forty-eighth Street, a cable was received from a<br/>substantial client living in Rio de Janeiro that said simply, “Please sell out everything in my account.”<br/>Lacking the time to conduct a long-distance argument in favor of forbearance, Merrill Lynch had no<br/>choice but to carry out the order. Radio and television stations, which by early afternoon had caught<br/>the scent of news, were now interrupting their regular programs with spot broadcasts on the situation;<br/>as a Stock Exchange publication has since commented, with some asperity, “The degree of attention<br/>devoted to the stock market in these news broadcasts may have contributed to the uneasiness among<br/>some investors.” And the problem that brokers faced in executing the flood of selling orders was by<br/>this time vastly complicated by technical factors. The tape delay, which by 2:26 amounted to fifty-<br/>five minutes, meant that for the most part the ticker was reporting the prices of an hour before, which<br/>in many cases were anywhere from one to ten dollars a share higher than the current prices. It was<br/>almost impossible for a broker accepting a selling order to tell his customer what price he might<br/>expect to get. Some brokerage firms were trying to circumvent the tape delay by using makeshift<br/>reporting systems of their own; among these was Merrill Lynch, whose floor brokers, after<br/>completing a trade, would—if they remembered and had the time—simply shout the result into a<br/>floorside telephone connected to a “squawk box” in the firm’s head  office, at 70 Pine Street.<br/>Obviously, haphazard methods like this were subject to error.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10"><span>On the Stock Exchange floor itself, there was no question of any sort of rally; it was simply a case<br/>of all stocks’ declining rapidly and  steadily, on enormous volume. As de la Vega might have<br/>described the scene—as, in fact, he </span></a><i>did </i><span>rather flamboyantly describe a similar scene—“The bears<br/>[that is, the sellers] are completely ruled by fear, trepidation, and nervousness. Rabbits become<br/>elephants, brawls in a tavern become rebellions, faint shadows appear to them as signs of chaos.”<br/>Not the least worrisome aspect of the situation was the fact that the leading bluechip stocks,<br/>representing shares in the country’s largest companies, were right in the middle of the decline;<br/>indeed, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest company of them all, and the one with the<br/>largest number of stockholders, was leading the entire market downward. On a share volume greater<br/>than that of any of the more than fifteen hundred other stocks traded on the Exchange (most of them at a<br/>tiny fraction of Telephone’s price), Telephone had been battered by wave after wave of urgent selling<br/>all day, until at two o’clock it stood at 104¾—down 6⅞ for the day—and was still in full retreat.<br/>Always something of a bellwether, Telephone was now being watched more closely than ever, and<br/>each loss of a fraction of a point in its price was the signal for further declines all across the board.<br/>Before three o’clock, I.B.M. was down 17½ points; Standard Oil of New Jersey, often exceptionally<br/>resistant to general declines, was off 3¼; and Telephone itself had tumbled again, to 101⅛. Nor did<br/>the bottom appear to be in sight.</span><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Yet the atmosphere on the floor, as it has since been described by men who were there, was not<br/>hysterical—or, at least, any hysteria was well controlled. While many brokers were straining to the<br/>utmost the Exchange’s rule against running on the floor, and some faces wore expressions that have<br/>been characterized by a conservative Exchange official as “studious,” there was the usual amount of<br/>joshing, horseplay, and exchanging of mild insults. (“Jokes … form a main attraction to the<br/>business.”—de la Vega.) But things were not entirely the same. “What I particularly remember is<br/>feeling physically exhausted,” one floor broker has said. “On a crisis day, you’re likely to walk ten or</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12"><span>eleven miles on the floor—that’s been measured with pedometers—but it isn’t just the distance that<br/>wears you down. It’s the physical contact. You have to push and get pushed. People climb all over<br/>you. Then, there were the sounds—the tense hum of voices that you always get in times of decline. As<br/>the rate of decline increases, so does the pitch of the hum. In a rising market, there’s an entirely<br/>different sound. After you get used to the difference, you can tell just about what the market is doing<br/>with your eyes shut. Of course, the usual heavy joking went on, and maybe the jokes got a little more<br/>forced than usual. Everybody has commented on the fact that when the closing bell rang, at three-<br/>thirty, a cheer went up from the floor. Well, we weren’t cheering because the market was down. We<br/>were cheering because it was over.”</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark13">BUT </a><span class="p">was it over? This question occupied Wall Street and the national investing community all the<br/>afternoon and evening. During the afternoon, the laggard Exchange ticker slogged along, solemnly<br/>recording prices that had long since become obsolete. (It was an hour and nine minutes late at closing<br/>time, and did not finish printing the day’s transactions until 5:58.) Many brokers stayed on the<br/>Exchange floor until after five o’clock, straightening out the details of trades, and then went to their<br/>offices to work on their accounts. What the price tape had to tell, when it finally got around to telling<br/>it, was a uniformly sad tale. American Telephone had closed at 100⅝, down 11 for the day. Philip<br/>Morris had closed at 71½, down 8¼ Campbell Soup had closed at 81, down 10¾. I.B.M. had closed<br/>at 361, down 37½. And so it went. In brokerage offices, employees were kept busy—many of them<br/>for most of the night—at various special chores, of which by far the most urgent was sending out<br/>margin calls. A margin call is a demand for additional collateral from a customer who has borrowed<br/>money from his broker to buy stocks and whose stocks are now worth barely enough to cover the<br/>loan. If a customer is unwilling or unable to meet a margin call with more collateral, his broker will<br/>sell the margined stock as soon as possible; such sales may depress other stocks further, leading to<br/>more margin calls, leading to more stock sales, and so on down into the pit. This pit had proved<br/>bottomless in 1929, when there were no federal restrictions on stock-market credit. Since then, a<br/>floor had been put in it, but the fact remains that credit requirements in May of 1962 were such that a<br/>customer could expect a call when stocks he had bought on margin had dropped to between fifty and<br/>sixty per cent of their value at the time he bought them. And at the close of trading on May 28th nearly<br/>one stock in four had dropped as far as that from its 1961 high. The Exchange has since estimated that<br/>91,700 margin calls were sent out, mainly by telegram, between May 25th and May 31st; it seems a<br/>safe assumption that the lion’s share of these went out in the afternoon, in the evening, or during the<br/>night of May 28th—and not just the early part of the night, either. More than one customer first<br/>learned of the crisis—or first became aware of its almost spooky intensity—on being awakened by<br/>the arrival of a margin call in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>If the danger to the market from the consequences of margin selling was much less in 1962 than it<br/>had been in 1929, the danger from another quarter—selling by mutual funds—was immeasurably<br/>greater. Indeed, many Wall Street professionals now say that at the height of the May excitement the<br/>mere thought of the mutual-fund situation was enough to make them shudder. As is well known to the<br/>millions of Americans who have bought shares in mutual funds over the past two decades or so, they<br/>provide a way for small investors to pool their resources under expert management; the small<br/>investor buys shares in a fund, and the fund uses the money to buy stocks and stands ready to redeem<br/>the investor’s shares at their current asset value whenever he chooses. In a serious stock-market<br/>decline, the reasoning went, small investors would want to get their money out of the stock market and<br/>would therefore ask for redemption of their shares; in order to raise the cash necessary to meet the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14"><span>redemption demands, the mutual funds would have to sell some of their stocks; these sales would lead<br/>to a further stock-market decline, causing more holders of fund shares to demand redemption—and so<br/>on down into a more up-to-date version of the bottomless pit. The investment community’s collective<br/>shudder at this possibility was intensified by the fact that the mutual funds’ power to magnify a market<br/>decline had never been seriously tested; practically nonexistent in 1929, the funds had built up the<br/>staggering total of twenty-three billion dollars in assets by the spring of 1962, and never in the interim<br/>had the market declined with anything like its present force. Clearly, if twenty-three billion dollars in<br/>assets, or any substantial fraction of that figure, were to be tossed onto the market now, it could<br/>generate a crash that would make 1929 seem like a stumble. A thoughtful broker named Charles J.<br/>Rolo, who was a book reviewer for the </span></a><i>Atlantic </i><span>until he joined Wall Street’s literary coterie in 1960,<br/>has recalled that the threat of a fund-induced downward spiral, combined with general ignorance as<br/>to whether or not one was already in progress, was “so terrifying that you didn’t even mention the<br/>subject.” As a man whose literary sensibilities had up to then survived the well-known crassness of<br/>economic life, Rolo was perhaps a good witness on other aspects of the downtown mood at dusk on<br/>May 28th. “There was an air of unreality,” he said later. “No one, as far as I knew, had the slightest<br/>idea where the bottom would be. The closing Dow-Jones average that day was down almost thirty-<br/>five points, to about five hundred and seventy-seven. It’s now considered elegant in Wall Street to<br/>deny it, but many leading people were talking about a bottom of four hundred—which would, of<br/>course, have been a disaster. One heard the words ‘four hundred’ uttered again and again, although if<br/>you ask people now, they tend to tell you they said ‘five hundred.’ And along with the apprehensions<br/>there was a profound feeling of depression of a very personal sort among brokers. We knew that our<br/>customers—by no means all of them rich—had suffered large losses as a result of our actions. Say<br/>what you will, it’s extremely disagreeable to lose other people’s money. Remember that this<br/>happened at the end of about twelve years of generally rising stock prices. After more than a decade<br/>of more or less constant profits to yourself and your customers, you get to think you’re pretty good.<br/>You’re on top of it. You can make money, and that’s that. This break exposed a weakness. It subjected<br/>one to a certain loss of self-confidence, from which one was not likely to recover quickly.” The<br/>whole thing was enough, apparently, to make a broker wish that he were in a position to adhere to de<br/>la Vega’s cardinal rule: “ </span><i>Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares</i><span>, because, where<br/>perspicacity is weakened, the most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark15">IT </a><span class="p">was on Tuesday morning that the dimensions of Monday’s debacle became evident. It had by now<br/>been calculated that the paper loss in value of all stocks listed on the Exchange amounted to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$20,800,000,000. This figure was an all-time record; even on October 28, 1929, the loss had been a<br/>mere $9,600,000,000, the key to the apparent inconsistency being the fact that the total value of the<br/>stocks listed on the Exchange was far smaller in 1929 than in 1962. The new record also represented<br/>a significant slice of our national income—specifically, almost four per cent. In effect, the United<br/>States had lost something like two weeks’ worth of products and pay in one day. And, of course, there<br/>were repercussions abroad. In Europe, where reactions to Wall Street are delayed a day by the time<br/>difference, Tuesday was the day of crisis; by nine o’clock that morning in New York, which was<br/>toward the end of the trading day in Europe, almost all the leading European exchanges were<br/>experiencing wild selling, with no apparent cause other than Wall Street’s crash. The loss in Milan<br/>was the worst in eighteen months. That in Brussels was the worst since 1946, when the Bourse there<br/>reopened after the war. That in London was the worst in at least twenty-seven years. In Zurich, there<br/>had been a sickening thirty-per-cent selloff earlier in the day, but some of the losses were now being</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>cut as bargain hunters came into the market. And another sort of backlash—less direct, but<br/>undoubtedly more serious in human terms—was being felt in some of the poorer countries of the<br/>world. For example, the price of copper for July delivery dropped on the New York commodity<br/>market by forty-four one-hundredths of a cent per pound. Insignificant as such a loss may sound, it<br/>was a vital matter to a small country heavily dependent on its copper exports. In his recent book “The<br/>Great Ascent,” Robert L. Heilbroner had cited an estimate that for every cent by which copper prices<br/>drop on the New York market the Chilean treasury lost four million dollars; by that standard, Chile’s<br/>potential loss on copper alone was $1,760,000.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16"><span>Yet perhaps worse than the knowledge of what had happened was the fear of what might happen<br/>now.The </span></a><i>Times </i><span>began a queasy lead editorial with the statement that “something resembling an<br/>earthquake hit the stock market yesterday,” and then took almost half a column to marshal its forces<br/>for      the reasonably ringing affirmation “Irrespective of the ups and downs of the stock market, we are<br/>and will remain the masters of our economic fate.” The Dow-Jones news ticker, after opening up<br/>shop at nine o’clock with its customary cheery “Good morning,” lapsed almost immediately into<br/>disturbing reports of the market news from abroad, and by 9:45, with the Exchange’s opening still a<br/>quarter of an hour away, was asking itself the jittery question “When will the dumping of stocks let<br/>up?” Not just yet, it concluded; all the signs seemed to indicate that the selling pressure was “far from<br/>satisfied.” Throughout the financial world, ugly rumors were circulating about the imminent failure of<br/>various securities firms, increasing the aura of gloom. (“The expectation of an event creates a much<br/>deeper impression … than the event itself.”—de la Vega.) The fact that most of these rumors later<br/>proved false was no help at the time. Word of the crisis had spread overnight to every town in the<br/>land, and the stock market had become the national preoccupation. In brokerage offices, the<br/>switchboards were jammed with incoming calls, and the customers’ areas with walk-ins and, in many<br/>cases, television crews. As for the Stock Exchange itself, everyone who worked on the floor had got<br/>there early, to batten down against the expected storm, and additional hands had been recruited from<br/>desk jobs on the upper floors of 11 Wall to help sort out the mountains of orders. The visitors’ gallery<br/>was so crowded by opening time that the usual guided tours had to be suspended for the day. One<br/>group that squeezed its way onto the gallery that morning was the eighth-grade class of Corpus Christi<br/>Parochial School, of West 121st Street; the class’s teacher, Sister Aquin, explained to a reporter that<br/>the children had prepared for their visit over the previous two weeks by making hypothetical stock-<br/>market investments with an imaginary ten thousand dollars each. “They lost all their money,” said<br/>Sister Aquin.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark17"><span>The Exchange’s opening was followed by the blackest ninety minutes in the memory of many<br/>veteran dealers, including some survivors of 1929. In the first few minutes, comparatively few stocks<br/>were traded, but this inactivity did not reflect calm deliberation; on the contrary, it reflected selling<br/>pressure so great that it momentarily paralyzed action. In the interests of minimizing sudden jumps in<br/>stock prices, the Exchange requires that one of its floor officials must personally grant his permission<br/>before any stock can change hands at a price differing from that of the previous sale by one point or<br/>more for a stock priced under twenty dollars, or by two points or more for a stock priced above<br/>twenty dollars. Now sellers were so plentiful and buyers so scarce that hundreds of stocks would<br/>have to open at price changes as great as that or greater, and therefore no trading in them was<br/>possible until a floor official could be found in the shouting mob. In the case of some of the key<br/>issues, like I.B.M., the disparity between sellers and buyers was so wide that trading in them was<br/>impossible even </span></a><i>with </i><span>the permission of an official, and there was nothing to do but wait until the<br/>prospect of getting a bargain price lured enough buyers into the market. The Dow-Jones broad tape,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>stuttering out random prices and fragments of information as if it were in a state of shock, reported at<br/>11:30 that “at least seven” Big Board stocks had still not opened; actually, when the dust had cleared<br/>it appeared that the true figure had been much larger than that. Meanwhile, the Dow-Jones average<br/>lost 11.09 more points in the first hour, Monday’s loss in stock values had been increased by several<br/>billion dollars, and the panic was in full cry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark18"><span>And along with panic came near chaos. Whatever else may be said about Tuesday, May 29th, it<br/>will be long remembered as the day when there was something very close to a complete breakdown<br/>of the reticulated, automated, mind-boggling complex of technical facilities that made nationwide<br/>stock-trading possible in a huge country where nearly one out of six adults was a stockholder. Many<br/>orders were executed at prices far different from the ones agreed to by the customers placing the<br/>orders; many others were lost in transmission, or in the snow of scrap paper that covered the<br/>Exchange floor, and were never executed at all. Sometimes brokerage firms were prevented from<br/>executing orders by simple inability to get in touch with their floor men. As the day progressed,<br/>Monday’s heavy-traffic records were not only broken but made to seem paltry; as one index,<br/>Tuesday’s closing-time delay in the Exchange tape was two hours and twenty-three minutes,<br/>compared to Monday’s hour and nine minutes. By a heaven-sent stroke of prescience, Merrill Lynch,<br/>which handled over thirteen per cent of all public trading on the Exchange, had just installed a new<br/>7074 computer—the device that can copy the Telephone Directory in three minutes—and, with its<br/>help, managed to keep its accounts fairly straight. Another new Merrill Lynch installation—an<br/>automatic teletype switching system that occupied almost half a city block and was intended to<br/>expedite communication between the firm’s various offices—also rose to the occasion, though it got<br/>so hot that it could not be touched. Other firms were less fortunate, and in a number of them confusion<br/>gained the upper hand so thoroughly that some brokers, tired of trying in vain to get the latest<br/>quotations on stocks or to reach their partners on the Exchange floor, are said to have simply thrown<br/>up their hands and gone out for a drink. Such unprofessional behavior may have saved their customers<br/>a great deal of money.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>But the crowning irony of the day was surely supplied by the situation of the tape during the lunch<br/>hour. Just before noon, stocks reached their lowest levels—down twenty-three points on the Dow-<br/>Jones average. (At its nadir, the average reached 553.75—a safe distance above the 500 that the<br/>experts now claim was their estimate of the absolute bottom.) Then they abruptly began an<br/>extraordinarily vigorous recovery. At 12:45, by which time the recovery had become a mad scramble<br/>to buy, the tape was fifty-six minutes late; therefore, apart from fleeting intimations supplied by a few<br/>“flash” prices, the ticker was engaged in informing the stock-market community of a selling panic at a<br/>moment when what was actually in progress was a buying panic.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark19">THE </a><span class="p">great turnaround late in the morning took place in a manner that would have appealed to de la<br/>Vega’s romantic nature—suddenly and rather melodramatically. The key stock involved was<br/>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which, just as on the previous day, was being universally watched<br/>and was unmistakably influencing the whole market. The key man, by the nature of his job, was<br/>George M. L. La Branche, Jr., senior partner in La Branche and Wood &amp; Co., the firm that was acting<br/>as floor specialist in Telephone. (Floor specialists  are broker-dealers  who are responsible for<br/>maintaining orderly markets in the particular stocks with which they are charged. In the course of<br/>meeting their responsibilities, they often have the curious duty of taking risks with their own money<br/>against their own better judgment. Various authorities, seeking to reduce the element of human<br/>fallibility in the market, have lately been trying to figure out a way to replace the specialists with</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>machines, but so far without success. One big stumbling block seems to be the question: If the<br/>mechanical specialists should lose their shirts, who would pay their losses?) La Branche, at sixty-<br/>four, was a short, sharp-featured, dapper, peppery man who was fond of sporting one of the Exchange<br/>floor’s comparatively few Phi Beta Kappa keys; he had been a specialist since 1924, and his firm had<br/>been the specialist in Telephone since late in 1929. His characteristic habitat—indeed, the spot<br/>where he spent some five and a half hours almost every weekday of his life—was immediately in<br/>front of Post 15, in the part of the Exchange that is not readily visible from the visitors’ gallery and is<br/>commonly called the Garage; there, feet planted firmly apart to fend off any sudden surges of would-<br/>be buyers or sellers, he customarily stood with pencil poised in a thoughtful way over an<br/>unprepossessing loose-leaf ledger, in which he kept a record of all outstanding orders to buy and sell<br/>Telephone stock at various price levels. Not surprisingly, the ledger was known as the Telephone<br/>book. La Branche had, of course, been at the center of the excitement all day Monday, when<br/>Telephone was leading the market downward. As specialist, he had been rolling with the punch like a<br/>fighter—or to adopt his own more picturesque metaphor, bobbing like a cork on ocean combers.<br/>“Telephone is kind of like the sea,” La Branche said later. “Generally, it is calm and kindly. Then all<br/>of a sudden a great wind comes and whips up a giant wave. The wave sweeps over and deluges<br/>everybody; then it sucks back again. You have to give with it. You can’t fight it, any more than King<br/>Canute could.” On Tuesday morning, after Monday’s drenching eleven-point drop, the great wave<br/>was still rolling; the sheer clerical task of sorting and matching the orders that had come in overnight</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark20"><span>—not to mention finding a Stock Exchange official and obtaining his permission—took so long that<br/>the first trade in Telephone could not be made until almost an hour after the Exchange’s opening.<br/>When Telephone did enter the lists, at one minute before eleven, its price was 98½—down 2⅛ from<br/>Monday’s closing. Over the next three-quarters of an hour or so, while the financial world watched it<br/>the way a sea captain might watch the barometer in a hurricane, Telephone fluctuated between 99,<br/>which it reached on momentary minor rallies, and 98⅛, which proved to be its bottom. It touched the<br/>lower figure on three separate occasions, with rallies between—a fact that La Branche has spoken of<br/>as if it had a magical or mystical significance. And perhaps it had; at any rate, after the third dip<br/>buyers of Telephone began to turn up at Post 15, sparse and timid at first, then more numerous and<br/>aggressive. At 11:45, the stock sold at 98¾; a few minutes later, at 99; at 11:50, at 99⅜; and finally,<br/>at 11:55, it sold at 100.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Many commentators have expressed the opinion that that first sale of Telephone at 100 marked the<br/>exact point at which the whole market changed direction. Since Telephone is among the stocks on<br/>which the ticker gives flashes during periods of tape delay, the financial community learned of the<br/>transaction almost immediately, and at a time when everything else it was hearing was very bad news<br/>indeed; the theory goes that the hard fact of Telephone’s recovery of almost two points worked<br/>together with a purely fortuitous circumstance—the psychological impact of the good, round number<br/>100—to tip the scales. La Branche, while agreeing that the rise of Telephone did a lot to bring about<br/>the general upturn, differs as to precisely which transaction was the crucial one. To him, the first sale<br/>at 100 was insufficient proof of lasting recovery, because it involved only a small number of shares<br/>(a hundred, as far as he remembers). He knew that in his book he had orders to sell almost twenty<br/>thousand shares of Telephone at 100. If the demand for shares at that price were to run out before this<br/>two-million-dollar supply was exhausted, then the price of Telephone would drop again, possibly<br/>going as low as 98⅛ for a fourth time. And a man like La Branche, given to thinking in nautical terms,<br/>may have associated a certain finality with the notion of going down for a fourth time.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21">It did not happen. Several small transactions at 100 were made in rapid succession, followed by</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>several more, involving larger volume. Altogether, about half the supply of the stock at that price was<br/>gone when John J. Cranley, floor partner of Dreyfus &amp; Co., moved unobtrusively into the crowd at<br/>Post 15 and bid 100 for ten thousand shares of Telephone—just enough to clear out the supply and<br/>thus pave the way for a further rise. Cranley did not say whether he was bidding on behalf of his firm,<br/>one of its customers, or the Dreyfus Fund, a mutual fund that Dreyfus &amp; Co. managed through one of<br/>its subsidiaries; the size of the order suggests that the principal was the Dreyfus Fund. In any case, La<br/>Branche needed only to say “Sold,” and as soon as the two men had made notations of it, the<br/>transaction was completed. Where-upon Telephone could no longer be bought for 100.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark22"><span>There is historical precedent (though not from de la Vega’s day) for the single large Stock<br/>Exchange transaction that turns the market, or is intended to turn it. At half past one on October 24,<br/>1929—the dreadful day that has gone down in financial history as Black Thursday—Richard<br/>Whitney, then acting president of the Exchange and probably the best-known figure on its floor, strode<br/>conspicuously (some say “jauntily”) up to the post where U.S. Steel was traded, and bid 205, the<br/>price of the last sale, for ten thousand shares. But there are two crucial differences between the 1929<br/>trade and the 1962 one. In the first place, Whitney’s stagy bid was a calculated effort to create an<br/>effect, while Cranley’s, delivered without fanfare, was apparently just a move to get a bargain for the<br/>Dreyfus Fund. Secondly, only an evanescent rally followed the 1929 deal—the next week’s losses<br/>made Black Thursday look no worse than gray—while a genuinely solid recovery followed the one in<br/>1962. The moral may be that psychological gestures on the Exchange are most effective when they are<br/>neither intended nor really needed. At all events, a general rally began almost immediately. Having<br/>broken through the 100 barrier, Telephone leaped wildly upward: at 12:18, it was traded at 101¼; at<br/>12:41, at 103½; and at 1:05, at 106¼. General Motors went from 45½ at 11:46 to 50 at 1:38.<br/>Standard Oil of New Jersey went from 46¾ at 11:46 to 51 at 1:28. U.S. Steel went from 49½ at<br/>11:40 to 52⅜ at 1:28. I.B.M. was, in its way, the most dramatic case of the lot. All morning, its stock<br/>had been kept out of trading by an overwhelming preponderance of selling orders, and the guesses as<br/>to its ultimate opening price varied from a loss of ten points to a loss of twenty or thirty; now such an<br/>avalanche of buying orders appeared that when it was at last technically possible for the stock to be<br/>traded, just before two o’clock, it opened </span></a><i>up </i><span>four points, on a huge block of thirty thousand shares. At<br/>12:28, less than half an hour after the big Telephone trade, the Dow-Jones news service was sure<br/>enough of what was happening to state flatly, “The market has turned strong.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And so it had, but the speed of the turnaround produced more irony. When the broad tape has<br/>occasion to transmit an extended news item, such as a report on a prominent man’s speech, it<br/>customarily breaks the item up into a series of short sections, which can then be transmitted at<br/>intervals, leaving time in the interstices for such spot news as the latest prices from the Exchange<br/>floor. This was what it did during the early afternoon of May 29th with a speech delivered to the<br/>National Press Club by H. Ladd Plumley, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce,<br/>which began to be reported on the Dow-Jones tape at 12:25, or at almost exactly the same time that<br/>the same news source declared the market to have turned strong. As the speech came out in sections<br/>on the broad tape, it created an odd effect indeed. The tape started off by saying that Plumley had<br/>called for “a thoughtful appreciation of the present lack of business confidence.” At this point, there<br/>was an interruption for a few minutes’ worth of stock prices, all of them sharply higher. Then the tape<br/>returned to Plumley, who was now warming to his task and blaming the stock-market plunge on “the<br/>coincidental impact of two confidence-upsetting factors—a dimming of profit expectations and<br/>President Kennedy’s quashing of the steel price increase.” Then came a longer interruption, chock-<br/>full of reassuring facts and figures. At its conclusion, Plumley was back on the tape, hammering away</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>at his theme, which had now taken on overtones of “I told you so.” “We have had an awesome<br/>demonstration that the ‘right business climate’ cannot be brushed off as a Madison Avenue cliché but<br/>is a reality much to be desired,” the broad tape quoted him as saying. So it went through the early<br/>afternoon; it must have been a heady time for the Dow-Jones subscribers, who could alternately<br/>nibble at the caviar of higher stock prices and sip the champagne of Plumley’s jabs at the Kennedy<br/>administration.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IT <span class="p">was during the last hour and a half on Tuesday that the pace of trading on the Exchange reached its<br/>most frantic. The official count of trades recorded after three o’clock (that is, in the last half hour)<br/>came to just over seven million shares—in normal times as they were reckoned in 1962, an unheard-<br/>of figure even for a whole day’s trading. When the closing bell sounded, a cheer again arose from the<br/>floor—this one a good deal more full-throated than Monday’s, because the day’s gain of 27.03 points<br/>in the Dow-Jones average meant that almost three-quarters of Monday’s losses had been recouped; of<br/>the $20,800,000,000 that had summarily vanished on Monday, $13,500,000,000 had now reappeared.<br/>(These heart-warming figures weren’t available until hours after the close, but experienced securities<br/>men are vouchsafed visceral intuitions of surprising statistical accuracy; some of them claim that at<br/>Tuesday’s closing they could feel in their guts a Dow-Jones gain of over twenty-five points, and there<br/>is no reason to dispute their claim.) The mood was cheerful, then, but the hours were long. Because of<br/>the greater trading volume, tickers ticked and lights burned even farther into the night than they had on<br/>Monday; the Exchange tape did not print the day’s last transaction until 8:15—four and three-quarters<br/>hours after it had actually occurred. Nor did the next day, Memorial Day, turn out to be a day off for<br/>the securities business. Wise old Wall Streeters had expressed the opinion that the holiday, falling by<br/>happy chance in the middle of the crisis and thus providing an opportunity for the cooling of<br/>overheated emotions, may have been the biggest factor in preventing the crisis from becoming a<br/>disaster. What it indubitably did provide was a chance for the Stock Exchange and its member<br/>organizations—all of whom had been directed to remain at their battle stations over the holiday—to<br/>begin picking up the pieces.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The insidious effects of a late tape had to be explained to thousands of naïve customers who<br/>thought they had bought U.S. Steel at, say, 50, only to find later that they had paid 54 or 55. The<br/>complaints of thousands of other customers could not be so easily answered. One brokerage house<br/>discovered that two orders it had sent to the floor at precisely the same time—one to buy Telephone<br/>at the prevailing price, the other to sell the same quantity at the prevailing price—had resulted in the<br/>seller’s getting 102 per share for his stock and the buyer’s paying 108 for his. Badly shaken by a<br/>situation that seemed to cast doubt on the validity of the law of supply and demand, the brokerage<br/>house made inquiries and found that the buying order had got temporarily lost in the crush and had<br/>failed to reach Post 15 until the price had gone up six points. Since the mistake had not been the<br/>customer’s, the brokerage firm paid him the difference. As for the Stock Exchange itself, it had a<br/>variety of problems to deal with on Wednesday, among them that of keeping happy a team of<br/>television men from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who, having forgotten all about the<br/>United States custom of observing a holiday on May 30th, had flown down from Montreal to take<br/>pictures of Wednesday’s action on the Exchange. At the same time, Exchange officials were<br/>necessarily pondering the problem of Monday’s and Tuesday’s scandalously laggard ticker, which<br/>everyone agreed had been at the very heart of—if not, indeed, the cause of—the most nearly<br/>catastrophic technical snarl in history. The Exchange’s defense of itself, later set down in detail,<br/>amounts, in effect, to a complaint that the crisis came two years too soon. “It would be inaccurate to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>suggest that all investors were served with normal speed and efficiency by existing facilities,” the<br/>Exchange conceded, with characteristic conservatism, and went on to say that a ticker with almost<br/>twice the speed of the present one was expected to be ready for installation in 1964. (In fact, the new<br/>ticker and various other automation devices, duly installed more or less on time, proved to be so<br/>heroically effective that the fantastic trading pace of April, 1968 was handled with only negligible<br/>tape delays.) The fact that the 1962 hurricane hit while the shelter was under construction was<br/>characterized by the Exchange as “perhaps ironic.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark23"><span>There was still plenty of cause for concern on Thursday morning. After a period of panic selling,<br/>the market has a habit of bouncing back dramatically and then resuming its slide. More than one<br/>broker recalled that on October 30, 1929—immediately after the all-time-record two-day decline,<br/>and immediately before the start of the truly disastrous slide that was to continue for years and<br/>precipitate the great depression—the Dow-Jones gain had been 28.40, representing a rebound<br/>ominously comparable to this one. In other words, the market still suffers at times from what de la<br/>Vega clinically called “antiperistasis”—the tendency to reverse itself, then reverse the reversal, and<br/>so on. A follower of the antiperistasis system of security analysis might have concluded that the<br/>market was now poised for another dive. As things turned out, of course, it wasn’t. Thursday was a<br/>day of steady, orderly rises in stock prices. Minutes after the ten-o’clock opening, the broad tape<br/>spread the news that brokers everywhere were being deluged with buying orders, many of them<br/>coming from South America, Asia, and the Western European countries that are normally active in the<br/>New York stock market. “Orders still pouring in from all directions,” the broad tape announced<br/>exultantly just before eleven. Lost money was magically reappearing, and more was on the way.<br/>Shortly before two o’clock, the Dow-Jones tape, having proceeded from euphoria to insouciance,<br/>took time off from market reports to include a note on plans for a boxing match between Floyd<br/>Patterson and Sonny Liston. Markets in Europe, reacting to New York on the upturn just as they had<br/>on the downturn, had risen sharply. New York copper futures had recovered over eighty per cent of<br/>their Monday and Tuesday-morning losses, so Chile’s treasury was mostly bailed out. As for the<br/>Dow-Jones industrial average at closing, it figured out to 613.36, meaning that the week’s losses had<br/>been wiped out </span></a><i>in toto</i><span>, with a little bit to spare. The crisis was over. In Morgan’s terms, the market<br/>had fluctuated; in de la Vega’s terms, antiperistasis had been demonstrated.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark24"><span class="s6">ALL </span></a><span>that summer, and even into the following year, security analysts and other experts cranked out<br/>their explanations of what had happened, and so great were the logic, solemnity, and detail of these<br/>diagnoses that they lost only a little of their force through the fact that hardly any of the authors had<br/>had the slightest idea what was </span><i>going </i><span>to happen before the crisis occurred. Probably the most<br/>scholarly and detailed report on who did the selling that caused the crisis was furnished by the New<br/>York Stock Exchange itself, which began sending elaborate questionnaires to its individual and<br/>corporate members immediately after the commotion was over. The Exchange calculated that during<br/>the three days of the crisis rural areas of the country were more active in the market than they<br/>customarily are; that women investors had sold two and a half times as much stock as men investors;<br/>that foreign investors were far more active than usual, accounting for 5.5 per cent of the total volume,<br/>and, on balance, were substantial sellers; and, most striking of all, that what the Exchange calls<br/>“public individuals”—individual investors, as opposed to institutional ones, which is to say people<br/>who would be described anywhere but on Wall Street as </span><i>private </i><span>individuals—played an<br/>astonishingly large role in the whole affair, accounting for an unprecedented 56.8 per cent of the total<br/>volume. Breaking down the public individuals into income categories, the Exchange calculated that</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>those with family incomes of over twenty-five thousand dollars a year were the heaviest and most<br/>insistent sellers, while those with incomes under ten thousand dollars, after selling on Monday and<br/>early on Tuesday, bought so many shares on Thursday that they actually became net buyers over the<br/>three-day period. Furthermore, according to the Exchange’s calculations, about a million shares—or</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>3.5 per cent of the total volume during the three days—were sold as a result of margin calls. In sum, if<br/>there was a villain, it appeared to have been the relatively rich investor not connected with the<br/>securities business—and, more often than might have been expected, the female, rural, or foreign one,<br/>in many cases playing the market partly on borrowed money.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The role of the hero was filled, surprisingly, by the most frightening of untested forces in the market</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark25"><span>—the mutual funds. The Exchange’s statistics showed that on Monday, when prices were plunging,<br/>the funds bought 530,000 more shares than they sold, while on Thursday, when investors in general<br/>were stumbling over each other trying to buy stock, the funds, on balance, </span></a><i>sold </i><span>375,000 shares; in<br/>other words, far from increasing the market’s fluctuation, the funds actually served as a stabilizing<br/>force. Exactly how this unexpectedly benign effect came about remains a matter of debate. Since no<br/>one has been heard to suggest that the funds acted out of sheer public-spiritedness during the crisis, it<br/>seems safe to assume that they were buying on Monday because their managers had spotted bargains,<br/>and were selling on Thursday because of chances to cash in on profits. As for the problem of<br/>redemptions, there were, as had been feared, a  large number of mutual-fund shareholders who<br/>demanded millions of dollars of their money in cash when the market crashed, but apparently the<br/>mutual funds had so much cash on hand that in most cases they could pay off their shareholders<br/>without selling substantial amounts of stock. Taken as a group, the funds proved to be so rich and so<br/>conservatively managed that they not only could weather the storm but, by happy inadvertence, could<br/>do something to decrease its violence. Whether the same conditions would exist in some future storm<br/>was and is another matter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In the last analysis, the cause of the 1962 crisis remains unfathomable; what is known is that it<br/>occurred, and that something like it could occur again. As one of Wall Street’s aged, ever-anonymous<br/>seers put it recently, “I was concerned, but at no time did I think it would be another 1929. I never<br/>said the Dow-Jones would go down to four hundred. I said </span><i>five </i><span>hundred. The point is that now, in<br/>contrast to 1929, the government, Republican or Democratic, realizes that it must be attentive to the<br/>needs of business. There will never be apple-sellers on Wall Street again. As to whether what<br/>happened that May can happen again—of course it can. I think that people may be more careful for a<br/>year or two, and then we may see another speculative buildup followed by another crash, and so on<br/>until God makes people less greedy.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Or, as de la Vega said, “It is foolish to think that you can withdraw from the Exchange after you<br/>have tasted the sweetness of the honey.”</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark26">2</a><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark28">The Fate of the Edsel</a><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">RISE AND FLOWERING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">IN </a><span class="p">the calendar of American economic life, 1955 was the Year of the Automobile. That year,<br/>American automobile makers sold over seven million passenger cars, or over a million more than<br/>they had sold in any previous year. That year, General Motors easily sold the public $325 million<br/>worth of new common stock, and the stock market as a whole, led by the motors, gyrated upward so<br/>frantically that Congress investigated it. And that year, too, the Ford Motor Company decided to<br/>produce a new automobile in what was quaintly called the medium-price range—roughly, from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$2,400 to $4,000—and went ahead and designed it more or less in conformity with the fashion of the<br/>day, which was for cars that were  long, wide, low, lavishly decorated with chrome, liberally<br/>supplied with gadgets, and equipped with engines of a power just barely insufficient to send them into<br/>orbit. Two years later, in September, 1957, the Ford Company put its new car, the Edsel, on the<br/>market, to the accompaniment of more fanfare than had attended the arrival of any other new car since<br/>the same company’s Model A, brought out thirty years earlier. The total amount spent on the Edsel<br/>before the first specimen went on sale was announced as a quarter of a billion dollars; its launching</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—as <i>Business Week </i><span>declared and nobody cared to deny—was more costly than that of any other<br/>consumer product in history. As a starter toward getting its investment back, Ford counted on selling<br/>at least 200,000 Edsels the first year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>There may be an aborigine somewhere in a remote rain forest who hasn’t yet heard that things<br/>failed to turn out that way. To be precise, two years two months and fifteen days later Ford had sold<br/>only 109,466 Edsels, and, beyond a doubt, many hundreds, if not several thousands, of those were<br/>bought by Ford executives, dealers, salesmen, advertising men, assembly-line workers, and others<br/>who had a personal interest in seeing the car succeed. The 109,466 amounted to considerably less<br/>than one per cent of the passenger cars sold in the United States during that period, and on November<br/>19, 1959, having lost, according to some outside estimates, around $350 million on the Edsel, the<br/>Ford Company permanently discontinued its production.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark31"><span>How could this have happened? How could a company so mightily endowed with money,<br/>experience, and, presumably, brains have been guilty of such a monumental mistake? Even before the<br/>Edsel was dropped, some of the more articulate members of the car-minded public had come forward<br/>with an answer—an answer so simple and so seemingly reasonable that, though it was not the only<br/>one advanced, it became widely accepted as the truth. The Edsel, these people argued, was designed,<br/>named, advertised, and promoted with a slavish adherence to the results of public-opinion polls and<br/>of their younger cousin, motivational research, and they concluded that when the public is wooed in<br/>an excessively calculated manner, it tends to turn away in favor of some gruffer but more</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>spontaneously attentive suitor. Several years ago, in the face of an understandable reticence on the<br/>part of the Ford Motor Company, which enjoys documenting its boners no more than anyone else, I set<br/>out to learn what I could about the Edsel debacle, and my investigations have led me to believe that<br/>what we have here is less than the whole truth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">For, although the Edsel was <i>supposed </i><span>to be advertised, and otherwise promoted, strictly on the<br/>basis of preferences expressed in polls, some old-fashioned snake-oil-selling methods, intuitive<br/>rather than scientific, crept in. Although it was </span><i>supposed </i><span>to have been named in much the same way,<br/>science was curtly discarded at the last minute and the Edsel  was named for the father of the<br/>company’s president, like a nineteenth-century brand of cough drops or saddle soap. As for the<br/>design, it was arrived at without even a pretense of consulting the polls, and by the method that has<br/>been standard for years in the designing of automobiles—that of simply pooling the hunches of sundry<br/>company committees. The common explanation of the Edsel’s downfall, then, under scrutiny, turns out<br/>to be largely a myth, in the colloquial sense of that term. But the facts of the case may live to become<br/>a myth of a symbolic sort—a modern American antisuccess story.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark32">THE </a><span class="p">origins of the Edsel go back to the fall of 1948, seven years before the year of decision, when<br/>Henry Ford II, who had been president and undisputed boss of the company since the death of his<br/>grandfather, the original Henry, a year earlier, proposed to the company’s executive committee,<br/>which included Ernest R. Breech, the executive vice-president, that studies be undertaken concerning<br/>the wisdom of putting on the market a new and wholly different medium-priced car. The studies were<br/>undertaken. There appeared to be good reason for them. It was a well-known practice at the time for<br/>low-income owners of Fords, Plymouths, and Chevrolets to turn in their symbols of inferior caste as<br/>soon as their earnings rose above five thousand dollars a year, and “trade up” to a medium-priced<br/>car. From Ford’s point of view, this would have been all well and good except that, for some reason,<br/>Ford owners usually traded up not to Mercury, the company’s only medium-priced car, but to one or<br/>another of the medium-priced cars put out by its big rivals—Oldsmobile, Buick, and Pontiac, among<br/>the General Motors products, and, to a lesser extent, Dodge and De Soto, the Chrysler candidates.<br/>Lewis D. Crusoe, then a vice-president of the Ford Motor Company, was not overstating the case<br/>when he said, “We have been growing customers for General Motors.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The outbreak of the Korean War, in 1950, meant that Ford had no choice but to go on growing<br/>customers for its competitors, since introducing a new car at such a time was out of the question. The<br/>company’s executive committee put aside the studies proposed by President Ford, and there matters<br/>rested for two years. Late in 1952, however, the end of the war appeared sufficiently imminent for the<br/>company to pick up where it had left off, and the studies were energetically resumed by a group<br/>called the Forward Product Planning Committee, which turned over much of the detailed work to the<br/>Lincoln-Mercury Division, under the direction of Richard Krafve (pronounced Kraffy), the division’s<br/>assistant general manager. Krafve, a forceful, rather saturnine man with a habitually puzzled look,<br/>was then in his middle forties. The son of a printer on a small farm journal in Minnesota, he had been<br/>a sales engineer and management consultant before joining Ford, in 1947, and although he could not<br/>have known it in 1952, he was to have reason to look puzzled. As the man directly responsible for the<br/>Edsel  and its fortunes, enjoying its brief glory and attending it in its mortal agonies, he had a<br/>rendezvous with destiny.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IN <span class="p">December, 1954, after two years’ work, the Forward Product Planning Committee submitted to the<br/>executive committee a six-volume blockbuster of a report summarizing its findings. Supported by</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark33"><span>copious statistics, the report predicted the arrival of the American millennium, or something a lot like<br/>it, in 1965. By that time, the Forward Product Planning Committee estimated, the gross national<br/>product would be $535 billion a year—up more than $135 billion in a decade. (As a matter of fact,<br/>this part of the millennium arrived much sooner than the Forward Planners estimated. The G. N. P.<br/>passed $535 billion in 1962, and for 1965 was $681 billion.) The number of cars in operation would<br/>be seventy million—up twenty million. More than half the families in the nation would have incomes<br/>of over five thousand dollars a year, and more than 40 percent of all the cars sold would be in the<br/>medium-price range or better. The report’s picture of America in 1965, presented in crushing detail,<br/>was of a country after Detroit’s own heart—its banks oozing money, its streets and highways choked<br/>with huge, dazzling medium-priced cars, its newly rich, “upwardly mobile” citizens racked with<br/>longings for more of them. The moral was clear. If by that time Ford had not come out with a second<br/>medium-priced car—not just a new model, but a new make—and made it a favorite in its field, the<br/>company would miss out on its share of the national boodle.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34"><span>On the other hand, the Ford bosses were well aware of the enormous risks connected with putting a<br/>new car on the market. They knew, for example, that of the 2,900 American makes that had been<br/>introduced since the beginning of the Automobile Age—the Black Crow (1905), the Averageman’s<br/>Car (1906), the Bug-mobile (1907), the Dan Patch (1911), and the Lone Star (1920) among them—<br/>only about twenty were still around. They knew all about the automotive casualties that had followed<br/>the Second World War—among them Crosley, which had given up altogether, and Kaiser Motors,<br/>which, though still alive in 1954, was breathing its last. (The members of the Forward Product<br/>Planning Committee must have glanced at each other uneasily when, a year later, Henry J. Kaiser<br/>wrote, in a valediction to his car business, “We expected to toss fifty million dollars into the<br/>automobile pond, but we didn’t expect it to disappear without a ripple.”) The Ford men also knew<br/>that neither of the other members of the industry’s powerful and well-heeled Big Three—General<br/>Motors and Chrysler—had ventured to bring out a new standard-size make since the former’s La<br/>Salle in 1927, and the latter’s Plymouth, in 1928, and that Ford itself had not attempted to turn the<br/>trick since 1938, when it launched the Mercury.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Nevertheless, the Ford men felt bullish—so remarkably bullish that they resolved to toss into the<br/>automobile pond five times the sum that Kaiser had. In April, 1955, Henry Ford II, Breech, and the<br/>other members of the executive committee officially approved the Forward Product Planning<br/>Committee’s findings, and, to implement them, set up another agency, called the Special Products<br/>Division, with the star-crossed Krafve as its head. Thus the company gave its formal sanction to the<br/>efforts of its designers, who, having divined the trend of events, had already been doodling for<br/>several months on plans for a new car. Since neither they nor the newly organized Krafve outfit, when<br/>it took over, had an inkling of what the thing on their drawing boards might be called, it became<br/>known to everybody at Ford, and even in the company’s press releases, as the E-Car—the “E,” it was<br/>explained, standing for “Experimental.”</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark75" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 15pt;" name="bookmark35">The man directly in charge of the E-Car’s design—or, to use the gruesome trade word, “styling”—<br/>was a Canadian, then not yet forty, named Roy A. Brown, who, before taking on the E-Car (and after<br/>studying industrial design at the Detroit Art Academy), had had a hand in the designing of radios,<br/>motor cruisers, colored-glass products, Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, and Lincolns.</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 15pt;">*</span> <span style=" color: #000;">Brown recently<br/>recalled his aspirations as he went to work on the new project. “Our goal was to create a vehicle<br/>which would be unique in the sense that it would be readily recognizable in styling theme from the<br/>nineteen other makes of cars on the road at that time,” he wrote from England, where at the time of his<br/>writing he was employed as chief stylist for the Ford Motor Company, Ltd., manufacturers of trucks,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>tractors, and small cars. “We went to the extent of making photographic studies from some distance of<br/>all nineteen of these cars, and it became obvious that at a distance of a few hundred feet the similarity<br/>was so great that it was practically impossible to distinguish one make from the others.… They were<br/>all ‘peas in a pod.’ We decided to select [a style that] would be ‘new’ in the sense that it was unique,<br/>and yet at the same time be familiar.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark36"><span>While the E-Car was on the drawing boards in Ford’s styling studio—situated, like its<br/>administrative offices, in the company’s barony of Dearborn, just outside Detroit—work on it<br/>progressed under the conditions of melodramatic, if ineffectual, secrecy that invariably attend such<br/>operations in the automobile business: locks on the studio doors that could be changed in fifteen<br/>minutes if a key should fall into enemy hands; a security force standing round-the-clock guard over the<br/>establishment; and a telescope to be trained at intervals on nearby high points of the terrain where<br/>peekers might be roosting. (All such precautions, however inspired, are doomed to fail, because none<br/>of them provide a defense against Detroit’s version of the Trojan horse—the job-jumping stylist,<br/>whose cheerful treachery makes it relatively easy for the rival companies to keep tabs on what the<br/>competition is up to. No one, of course, is better aware of this than the rivals themselves, but the<br/>cloak-and-dagger stuff is thought to pay for itself in publicity value.) Twice a week or so, Krafve—<br/>head down, and sticking to low ground—made the journey to the styling studio, where he would<br/>confer with Brown, check up on the work as it proceeded, and offer advice and encouragement.<br/>Krafve was not the kind of man to envision his objective in a single revelatory flash; instead, he<br/>anatomized the styling of the E-Car into a series of laboriously minute decisions—how to shape the<br/>fenders, what pattern to use with the chrome, what kind of door handles to put on, and so on and on. If<br/>Michelangelo ever added the number of decisions that went into the execution of, say, his “David,” he<br/>kept it to himself, but Krafve, an orderly-minded man in an era of orderly-functioning computers, later<br/>calculated that in styling the E-Car he and his associates had to make up their minds on no fewer than<br/>four thousand occasions. He reasoned at the time that if they arrived at the right yes-or-no choice on<br/>every one of those occasions, they ought, in the end, to come up with a stylistically perfect car—or at<br/>least a car that would be unique and at the same time familiar. But Krafve concedes today that he<br/>found it difficult thus to bend the creative process to the yoke of system, principally because many of<br/>the four thousand decisions he made wouldn’t stay put. “Once you get a general theme, you begin<br/>narrowing down,” he says. “You keep modifying, and then modifying your modifications. Finally, you<br/></span></a><i>have </i><span>to settle on something, because there isn’t any more time. If it weren’t for the deadline you’d<br/>probably go on modifying indefinitely.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Except for later, minor modifications of the modified modifications, the E-Car had been fully<br/>styled by midsummer of 1955. As the world was to learn two years later, its most striking aspect was<br/>a novel, horse-collar-shaped radiator grille, set vertically in the center of a conventionally low, wide<br/>front end—a blend of the unique and the familiar that was there for all to see, though certainly not for<br/>all to admire. In two prominent respects, however, Brown or Krafve, or both, lost sight entirely of the<br/>familiar, specifying a unique rear end, marked by widespread horizontal wings that were in bold<br/>contrast to the huge longitudinal tail fins then captivating the market, and a unique cluster of<br/>automatic-transmission push buttons on the hub of the steering wheel. In a speech to the public<br/>delivered a while before the public had its first look at the car, Krafve let fall a hint or two about its<br/>styling, which, he said, made it so “distinctive” that, externally, it was “immediately recognizable<br/>from front, side, and rear,” and, internally, it was “the epitome of the push-button era without wild-<br/>blue-yonder Buck Rogers concepts.” At last came the day when the men in the highest stratum of the<br/>Ford Hierarchy were given their first glimpse of the car. It produced an effect that was little short of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>apocalyptic. On August 15, 1955, in the ceremonial secrecy of the styling center, while Krafve,<br/>Brown, and their aides stood by smiling nervously and washing their hands in air, the members of the<br/>Forward Product Planning Committee, including Henry Ford II and Breech, watched critically as a<br/>curtain was lifted to reveal the first full-size model of the E-Car—a clay one, with tinfoil simulating<br/>aluminum and chrome. According to eyewitnesses, the audience sat in utter silence for what seemed<br/>like a full minute, and then, as one man, burst into a round of applause. Nothing of the kind had ever<br/>happened at an intracompany first showing at Ford since 1896, when old Henry had bolted together<br/>his first horseless carriage.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37"><span class="s6">ONE </span></a><a href="#bookmark76" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 15pt;">of the most persuasive and most frequently cited explanations of the Edsel’s failure is that it was<br/>a victim of the time lag between the decision to produce it and the act of putting it on the market. It<br/>was easy to see a few years later, when smaller and less powerful cars, euphemistically called<br/>“compacts,” had become so popular as to turn the old automobile status-ladder upside down, that the<br/>Edsel was a giant step in the wrong direction, but it was far from easy to see that in fat, tail-finny<br/>1955. American ingenuity—which has produced the electric light, the flying machine, the tin Lizzie,<br/>the atomic bomb, and even a tax system that permits a man, under certain circumstances, to clear a<br/>profit by making a charitable donation </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 15pt;">*</span><span>—has not yet found a way of getting an automobile on the<br/>market within a reasonable time after it comes off the drawing board; the making of steel dies, the<br/>alerting of retail dealers, the preparation of advertising and promotion campaigns, the gaining of<br/>executive approval for each successive move, and the various other gavotte-like routines that are<br/>considered as vital as breathing in Detroit and its environs usually consume about two years.<br/>Guessing future tastes is hard enough for those charged with planning the customary annual changes in<br/>models of established makes; it is far harder to bring out an altogether new creation, like the E-Car,<br/>for which several intricate new steps must be worked into the dance pattern, such as endowing the<br/>product with a personality and selecting a suitable name for it, to say nothing of consulting various<br/>oracles in an effort to determine whether, by the time of the unveiling, the state of the national<br/>economy will make bringing out </span><i>any </i>new car seem like a good idea.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark38"><span>Faithfully executing the prescribed routine, the Special Products Division called upon its director<br/>of planning for market research, David Wallace, to see what he could do about imparting a<br/>personality to the E-Car and giving it a name. Wallace, a lean, craggy-jawed pipe puffer with a soft,<br/>slow, thoughtful way of speaking, gave the impression of being the Platonic idea of the college<br/>professor—the very steel die from which the breed is cut—although, in point of fact, his background<br/>was not strongly academic. Before going to Ford, in 1955, he had worked his way through<br/>Westminster College, in Pennsylvania, ridden out the depression as a construction laborer in New<br/>York City, and then spent ten years in market research at </span></a><i>Time</i><span>. Still, impressions are what count, and<br/>Wallace has admitted that during his tenure with Ford he consciously stressed his professorial air for<br/>the sake of the advantage it gave him in dealing with the bluff, practical men of Dearborn. “Our<br/>department came to be regarded as a semi-Brain Trust,” he says, with a certain satisfaction. He<br/>insisted, typically, on living in Ann Arbor, where he could bask in the scholarly aura of the University<br/>of Michigan, rather than in Dearborn or Detroit, both of which he declared were intolerable after<br/>business hours. Whatever the degree of his success in projecting the image of the E-Car, he seems, by<br/>his small eccentricities, to have done splendidly at projecting the image of Wallace. “I don’t think<br/>Dave’s motivation for being at Ford was basically economic,” his old boss, Krafve, says. “Dave is<br/>the scholarly type, and I think he considered the job an interesting challenge.” One could scarcely ask<br/>for better evidence of image projection than that.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39"><span>Wallace clearly recalls the reasoning—candid enough—that guided him and his assistants as they<br/>sought just the right personality for the E-Car. “We said to ourselves, ‘Let’s face it—there is no great<br/>difference in basic mechanism between a two-thousand-dollar Chevrolet and a six-thousand-dollar<br/>Cadillac,’” he says. “‘Forget about all the ballyhoo,’ we said, ‘and you’ll see that they are really<br/>pretty much the same thing. Nevertheless, there’s something—there’s </span></a><i>got </i><span>to be something—in the<br/>makeup of a certain number of people that gives them a yen for a Cadillac, in spite of its high price,<br/>or maybe because of it.’ We concluded that cars are the means to a sort of dream fulfillment. There’s<br/>some irrational factor in people that makes them want one kind of car rather than another—something<br/>that has nothing to do with the mechanism at all but with the car’s personality, as the customer<br/>imagines it. What we wanted to do, naturally, was to give the E-Car the personality that would make<br/>the greatest number of people want it. We figured we had a big advantage over the other<br/>manufacturers of medium-priced cars, because we didn’t have to worry about changing a pre-existent,<br/>perhaps somewhat obnoxious personality. All we had to do was create the exact one we wanted—<br/>from scratch.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>As the first step in determining what the E-Car’s exact personality should be, Wallace decided to<br/>assess the personalities of the medium-priced cars already on the market, and those of the so-called<br/>low-priced cars as well, since the cost of some of the cheap cars’ 1955 models had risen well up into<br/>the medium-price range. To this end, he engaged the Columbia University Bureau of Applied Social<br/>Research to interview eight hundred recent car buyers in Peoria, Illinois, and another eight hundred in<br/>San Bernardino, California, on the mental images they had of the various automobile makes<br/>concerned. (In undertaking this commercial enterprise, Columbia maintained its academic<br/>independence by reserving the right to publish its findings.) “Our idea was to get the reaction in<br/>cities, among clusters of people,” Wallace says. “We didn’t want a cross section. What we wanted<br/>was something that would show interpersonal factors. We picked Peoria as a place that is<br/>Midwestern, stereotyped, and not loaded with extraneous factors—like a General Motors glass plant,<br/>say.       We picked San Bernardino because the West Coast is very important in the automobile business,<br/>and because the market there is quite different—people tend to buy flashier cars.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>The questions that the Columbia researchers fared forth to ask in Peoria and San Bernardino dealt<br/>exhaustively with practically everything having to do with automobiles except such matters as how<br/>much they cost, how safe they were, and whether they ran. In particular, Wallace wanted to know the<br/>respondents’ impressions of each of the existing makes. Who, in their opinion, would naturally own a<br/>Chevrolet or a Buick or whatever? People of what age? Of which sex? Of what social status? From<br/>the answers, Wallace found it easy to put together a personality portrait of each make. The image of<br/>the Ford came into focus as that of a very fast, strongly masculine car, of no particular social<br/>pretensions, that might characteristically be driven by a rancher or  an automobile mechanic. In<br/>contrast, Chevrolet emerged as older, wiser, slower, a bit less rampantly masculine, and slightly<br/>more distingué—a clergyman’s car. Buick jelled into a middle-aged lady—or, at least, more of a lady<br/>than Ford, sex in cars having proved to be relative—with a bit of the devil still in her, whose most<br/>felicitous mate would be a lawyer, a doctor, or a dance-band leader. As for the Mercury, it came out<br/>as virtually a hot rod, best suited to a young-buck racing driver; thus, despite its higher price tag, it<br/>was associated with persons having incomes no higher than the average Ford owner’s, so no wonder<br/>Ford owners had not been trading up to it. This odd discrepancy between image and fact, coupled<br/>with the circumstance that, in sober truth all four makes looked very much alike and had almost the<br/>same horsepower under their hoods, only served to bear out Wallace’s premise that the automobile<br/>fancier, like a young man in love, is incapable of sizing up the object of his affections in anything</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">resembling a rational manner.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>By the time the researchers closed the books on Peoria and San Bernardino, they had elicited<br/>replies not only to these questions but to others, several of which, it would appear, only the most<br/>abstruse sociological thinker could relate to medium-priced cars. “Frankly, we dabbled,” Wallace<br/>says. “It was a dragnet operation.” Among the odds and ends that the dragnet dredged up were some<br/>that, when pieced together, led the researchers to report:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>By looking at those respondents whose annual incomes range from $4,000 to $11,000, we can make an … observation. A considerable<br/>percentage of these respondents [to a question about their ability to mix cocktails] are in the “somewhat” category on ability to mix<br/>cocktails.… Evidently, they do not have much confidence in their cocktail-mixing ability. We may infer that these respondents are aware<br/>of the fact that they are in the learning process. They may be able to mix Martinis or Manhattans, but beyond these popular drinks they<br/>don’t have much of a repertoire.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Wallace, dreaming of an ideally lovable E-Car, was delighted as returns like these came pouring<br/>into his Dearborn office. But when the time for a final decision drew near, it became clear to him that<br/>he must put aside peripheral issues like cocktail-mixing prowess and address himself once more to<br/>the old problem of the image. And here, it seemed to him, the greatest pitfall was the temptation to<br/>aim, in accordance with what he took to be the trend of the times, for extremes of masculinity,<br/>youthfulness, and speed; indeed, the following passage from one of the Columbia reports, as he<br/>interpreted it, contained a specific warning against such folly.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>Offhand we might conjecture that women who drive cars probably work, and are more mobile than non-owners, and get gratifications<br/>out of mastering a traditionally male role. But … there is no doubt that whatever gratifications women get out of their cars, and whatever<br/>social imagery they attach to their automobiles, they do want to appear as women. Perhaps more worldly women, but women.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Early in 1956, Wallace set about summing up all of his department’s findings in a report to his<br/>superiors in the Special Products Division. Entitled “The Market and Personality Objectives of the E-<br/>Car” and weighty with facts and statistics—though generously interspersed with terse sections in<br/>italics or capitals from which a hard-pressed executive could get the gist of the thing in a matter of<br/>seconds—the report first indulged in some airy, skippable philosophizing and then got down to<br/>conclusions:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">What happens when an owner sees his make as a car which a <i>woman </i>might buy, but is himself a <i>man? </i><span>Does this apparent<br/>inconsistency of car image and the buyer’s own characteristics affect his trading plans? The answer quite definitely is </span><i>Yes</i><span>. When there<br/>is a conflict between owner characteristics and make image, there is greater planning to switch to another make. In other words, when<br/>the buyer is a different kind of person from the person he thinks would own his make, he wants to change to a make in which he,<br/>inwardly, will be more comfortable.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 29pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>It should be noted that “conflict,” as used here, can be of two kinds. Should a make have a strong and well-defined image, it is<br/>obvious that an owner with strong opposing characteristics would be in conflict. But conflict also can occur when the make image is<br/>diffuse or weakly defined. In this case, the owner is in an equally frustrating position of not being able to get a satisfactory identification<br/>from his make.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The question, then, was how to steer between the Scylla of a too definite car personality and the<br/>Charybdis of a too weak personality. To this the report replied, “Capitalize on imagery weakness of<br/>competition,” and went on to urge that in the matter of age the E-Car should take an imagery position<br/>neither too young nor too old but right alongside that of the middling Olds-mobile; that in the matter of<br/>social class, not to mince matters, “the E-Car might well take a status position just below Buick and<br/>Oldsmobile”; and that in the delicate matter of sex it should try to straddle the fence, again along with<br/>the protean Olds. In sum (and in Wallace typography):</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>The most advantageous personality for the E-Car might well be THE SMART CAR FOR THE YOUNGER EXECUTIVE OR<br/>PROFESSIONAL FAMILY ON ITS WAY UP.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span>Smart car: recognition by others of the owner’s good style and taste.<br/>Younger: appealing to spirited but responsible adventurers.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span>Executive or professional: millions pretend to this status, whether they can attain it or not.<br/>Family: not exclusively masculine; a wholesome “good” role.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">On Its Way Up: “The E-Car has faith in you, son; we’ll help you make it!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40"><span>Before spirited but responsible adventurers could have faith in the E-Car, however, it had to have<br/>a name. Very early in its history, Krafve had suggested to members of the Ford family that the new car<br/>be named for Edsel Ford, who was the only son of old Henry; the president of the Ford Motor<br/>Company from 1918 until his death, in 1943; and the father of the new generation of Fords—Henry II,<br/>Benson, and William Clay. The three brothers had let Krafve know that their father might not have<br/>cared to have his name spinning on a million hubcaps, and they had consequently suggested that the<br/>Special Products Division start looking around for a substitute. This it did, with a zeal no less<br/>emphatic than it displayed in the personality crusade. In the late summer and early fall of 1955,<br/>Wallace hired the services of several research outfits, which sent interviewers, armed with a list of<br/>two thousand possible names, to canvass sidewalk crowds in New York, Chicago, Willow Run, and<br/>Ann Arbor. The interviewers did not ask simply what the respondent thought of some such name as<br/>Mars, Jupiter, Rover, Ariel, Arrow, Dart, or Ovation. They asked what free associations each name<br/>brought to mind, and having got an answer to this one, they asked what word or words was<br/>considered the opposite of each name, on the theory that, subliminally speaking, the opposite is as<br/>much      a part of a name as the tail is of a penny. The results of all this, the Special Products Division<br/>eventually decided, were inconclusive. Meanwhile, Krafve and his men held repeated sessions in a<br/>darkened room, staring, with the aid of a spotlight, at a series of cardboard signs, each bearing a<br/>name, as, one after another, they were flipped over for their consideration. One of the men thus<br/>engaged spoke up for the name Phoenix, because of its connotations of ascendancy, and another<br/>favored Altair, on the ground that it would lead practically all alphabetical lists of cars and thus<br/>enjoy an advantage analogous to that enjoyed in the animal kingdom by the aardvark. At a certain<br/>drowsy point in one session, somebody suddenly called a halt to the card-flipping and asked, in an<br/>incredulous tone, “Didn’t I see ‘Buick’ go by two or three cards back?” Everybody looked at<br/>Wallace, the impresario of the sessions. He puffed on his pipe, smiled an academic smile, and<br/>nodded.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark41"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>card-flipping sessions proved to be as fruitless as the sidewalk interviews, and it was at this<br/>stage of the game that Wallace, resolving to try and wring from genius what the common mind had<br/>failed to yield, entered into the celebrated car-naming correspondence with the poet Marianne Moore,<br/>which was later published in </span><i>The New Yorker </i><span>and still later, in book form, by the Morgan Library.<br/>“We should like this name … to convey, through association or other conjuration, some visceral<br/>feeling of elegance, fleetness, advanced features and design,” Wallace wrote to Miss Moore,<br/>achieving a certain feeling of elegance himself. If it is asked who among the gods of Dearborn had the<br/>inspired and inspiriting idea of enlisting Miss Moore’s services in this cause, the answer, according<br/>to Wallace, is that it was no god but the wife of one of his junior assistants—a young lady who had<br/>recentlygraduated from Mount Holyoke, where she had heard Miss Moore lecture. Had her<br/>husband’s superiors gone a step further and actually adopted one of Miss Moore’s many suggestions</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—Intelligent Bullet, for instance, or Utopian Turtletop, or Bullet Cloisonné, or Pastelogram, or<br/>Mongoose Civique, or Andante con Moto (“Description of a good motor?” Miss Moore queried in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>regard to this last)—there is no telling to what heights the E-Car might have risen, but the fact is that<br/>they didn’t. Dissatisfied with both the poet’s ideas and their own, the executives in the Special<br/>Products Division next called in Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, the advertising agency that had lately been<br/>signed up to handle the E-Car account. With characteristic Madison Avenue vigor, Foote, Cone &amp;<br/>Belding organized a competition among the employees of its New York, London, and Chicago offices,<br/>offering nothing less than one of the brand-new cars as a prize to whoever thought up an acceptable<br/>name. In no time at all, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding had eighteen thousand names in hand, including Zoom,<br/>Zip, Benson, Henry, and Drof (if in doubt, spell it backward). Suspecting that the bosses of the<br/>Special Products Division might regard this list as a trifle unwieldy, the agency got to work and cut it<br/>down to six thousand names, which it presented to them in executive session. “There you are,” a<br/>Foote, Cone man said triumphantly, flopping a sheaf of papers on the table. “Six thousand names, all<br/>alphabetized and cross-referenced.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A gasp escaped Krafve. “But we don’t want six thousand names,” he said. “We only want one.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark42"><span>The situation was critical, because the making of dies for the new car was about to begin and some<br/>of them would have to bear its name. On a Thursday, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding canceled all leaves and<br/>instituted what is called a crash program, instructing its New York and Chicago offices to set about<br/>independently cutting down the list of six thousand names to ten and to have the job done by the end of<br/>the weekend. Before the weekend was over, the two Foote, Cone offices presented their separate lists<br/>of ten to the Special Products Division, and by an almost incredible coincidence, which all hands<br/>insist </span></a><i>was </i><span>a coincidence, four of the names on the two lists were the same; Corsair, Citation, Pacer,<br/>and Ranger had miraculously survived the dual scrutiny. “Corsair seemed to be head and shoulders<br/>above everything else,” Wallace says. “Along with other factors in its favor, it had done splendidly in<br/>the sidewalk interviews. The free associations with Corsair were rather romantic—‘pirate,’<br/>‘swashbuckler,’ things like that. For its opposite, we got ‘princess,’ or something else attractive on<br/>that order. Just what we wanted.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Corsair or no Corsair, the E-Car was named the Edsel in the early spring of 1956, though the<br/>public was not informed until the following autumn. The epochal decision was reached at a meeting<br/>of the Ford executive committee held at a time when, as it happened, all three Ford brothers were<br/>away. In President Ford’s absence, the meeting was conducted by Breech, who had become chairman<br/>of the board in 1955, and his mood that day was brusque, and not one to linger long over<br/>swashbucklers and princesses. After hearing the final choices, he said, “I don’t like any of them. Let’s<br/>take another look at some of the others.” So they took another look at the favored rejects, among them<br/>the name Edsel, which, in spite of the three Ford brothers’ expressed interpretation of their father’s<br/>probable wishes, had been retained as a sort of anchor to windward. Breech led his associates in a<br/>patient scrutiny of the list until they came to “Edsel.” “Let’s call it that,” Breech said with calm<br/>finality. There were to be four main models of the E-Car, with variations on each one, and Breech<br/>soothed some of his colleagues by adding that the magic four—Corsair, Citation, Pacer, and Ranger</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—might be used, if anybody felt so inclined, as the subnames for the models. A telephone call was<br/>put through to Henry II, who was vacationing in Nassau. He said that if Edsel was the choice of the<br/>executive committee, he would abide by its decision, provided he could get the approval of the rest of<br/>his family. Within a few days, he got it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark43"><span>As Wallace wrote to Miss Moore a while later: “We have chosen a name.… It fails somewhat of<br/>the resonance, gaiety, and zest we were seeking. But it has a personal dignity and meaning to many of<br/>us here. Our name, dear Miss Moore, is—Edsel. I hope you will understand.”</span></a></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IT <span class="p">may be assumed that word of the naming of the E-Car spread a certain amount of despair among the<br/>Foote, Cone &amp; Belding backers of more metaphorical names, none of whom won a free car—a<br/>despair heightened by the fact that the name “Edsel” had been ruled out of the competition from the<br/>first. But their sense of disappointment was as nothing compared to the gloom that enveloped many<br/>employees of the Special Products Division. Some felt that the name of a former president of the<br/>company, who had sired its current president, bore dynastic connotations that were alien to the<br/>American temper; others, who, with Wallace, had put their trust in the quirks of the mass unconscious,<br/>believed that “Edsel” was a disastrously unfortunate combination of syllables. What were its free<br/>associations? Pretzel, diesel, hard sell. What was its opposite? It didn’t seem to have any. Still, the<br/>matter was settled, and there was nothing to do but put the best possible face on it. Besides, the<br/>anguish in the Special Products Division was by no means unanimous, and Krafve himself, of course,<br/>was among those who had no objection to the name. He still has none, declining to go along with<br/>those who contend that the decline and fall of the Edsel may be dated from the moment of its<br/>christening.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark44"><span>Krafve, in fact, was so well pleased with the way matters had turned out that when, at eleven<br/>o’clock on the morning of November 19, 1956, after a long summer of thoughtful silence, the Ford<br/>Company released to the world the glad tidings that the E-Car had been named the Edsel, he<br/>accompanied the announcement with a few dramatic flourishes of his own. On the very stroke of that<br/>hour on that day, the telephone operators in Krafve’s domain began greeting callers with “Edsel<br/>Division” instead of “Special Products Division”; all stationery bearing the obsolete letterhead of the<br/>division vanished and was replaced by sheaves of paper headed “Edsel Division”; and outside the<br/>building a huge stainless-steel sign reading </span></a><span class="s6">“EDSEL DIVISION” </span><span>rose ceremoniously to the rooftop.<br/>Krafve himself managed to remain earthbound, though he had his own reasons for feeling buoyant; in<br/>recognition of his leadership of the E-Car project up to that point, he was given the august title of<br/>Vice-President of the Ford Motor Company and General Manager, Edsel Division.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>From the administrative point of view, this off-with-the-old-on-with-the-new effect was merely<br/>harmless window dressing. In the strict secrecy of the Dearborn test track, vibrant, almost full-<br/>fledged Edsels, with their name graven on their superstructures, were already being road-tested;<br/>Brown and his fellow stylists were already well along with their designs for the </span><i>next </i><span>year’s Edsel;<br/>recruits were already being signed up for an entirely new organization of retail dealers to sell the<br/>Edsel to the public; and Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, having been relieved of the burden of staging crash<br/>programs to collect names and crash programs to get rid of them again, was already deep in schemes<br/>for advertising the Edsel, under the personal direction of a no less substantial pillar of his trade than<br/>Fairfax M. Cone, the agency’s head man. In planning his campaign, Cone relied heavily on what had<br/>come to be called the “Wallace prescription”; that is, the formula for the Edsel’s personality as set<br/>forth by Wallace back in the days before the big naming bee—“The smart car for the younger<br/>executive or professional family on its way up.” So enthusiastic was Cone about the prescription that<br/>he accepted it with only one revision—the substitution of “middle-income” family for “younger<br/>executive,” his hunch being that there were more middle-income families around than young<br/>executives, or even people who </span><i>thought </i><span>they were young executives. In an expansive mood, possibly<br/>induced by his having landed an account that was expected to bring billings of well over ten million<br/>dollars a year, Cone described to reporters on several occasions the kind of campaign he was plotting<br/>for the Edsel—quiet, self-assured, and avoiding as much as possible the use of the adjective “new,”<br/>which, though it had an obvious application to the product, he considered rather lacking in cachet.<br/>Above all, the campaign was to be classic in its calmness. “We think it would be awful for the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark45"><span>advertising to compete with the car,” Cone told the press. “We hope that no one will ever ask, ‘Say,<br/>did  you see that Edsel ad?’ in any newspaper or magazine or on television, but, instead, that hundreds<br/>of thousands of people will say, and say again, ‘Man, did you read about that Edsel?’ or ‘Did you see<br/>that car?’ This is the difference between advertising and selling.” Evidently enough, Cone felt<br/>confident about the campaign and the Edsel. Like a chess master who has no doubt that he will win,<br/>he could afford to explicate the brilliance of his moves even as he made them.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Automobile men still talk, with admiration for the virtuosity displayed and a shudder at the ultimate<br/>outcome, of the Edsel Division’s drive to round up retail dealers. Ordinarily, an established<br/>manufacturer launches a new car through dealers who are already handling his other makes and who,<br/>to begin with, take on the upstart as a sort of sideline. Not so in the case of the Edsel; Krafve received<br/>authorization from on high to go all out and build up a retail-dealer organization by making raids on<br/>dealers who had contracts with other manufacturers, or even with the other Ford Company divisions</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—Ford and Lincoln-Mercury. (Although the Ford dealers thus corralled were not obliged to cancel<br/>their old contracts, all the emphasis was on signing up retail outlets exclusively dedicated to the<br/>selling of Edsels.) The goal set for Introduction Day—which, after a great deal of soul-searching,<br/>was finally established as September 4, 1957—was twelve hundred Edsel dealers from coast to<br/>coast. They were not to be just any dealers, either; Krafve made it clear that Edsel was interested in<br/>signing up only dealers whose records showed that they had a marked ability to sell cars without<br/>resorting to the high-pressure tricks of borderline legality that had lately been giving the automobile<br/>business a bad name. “We simply have to have quality dealers with quality service facilities,” Krafve<br/>said. “A customer who gets poor service on an established brand blames the dealer. On an Edsel, he<br/>will blame the car.” The goal of twelve hundred was a high one, for no dealer, quality or not, can<br/>afford to switch makes lightly. The average dealer has at least a hundred thousand dollars tied up in<br/>his agency, and in large cities the investment is much higher. He must hire salesmen, mechanics, and<br/>office help; buy his own tools, technical literature, and signs, the latter costing as much as five<br/>thousand dollars a set; and pay the factory spot cash for the cars he receives from it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark46"><span>The man charged with mobilizing an Edsel sales force along these exacting lines was J. C. (Larry)<br/>Doyle, who, as general sales-and-marketing manager of the division, ranked second to Krafve<br/>himself. A veteran of forty years with the Ford Company, who had started with it as an office boy in<br/>Kansas City and had spent the intervening time mainly selling, Doyle was a maverick in his field. On<br/>the one hand, he had an air of kindness and consideration that made him the very antithesis of the glib,<br/>brash denizens of a thousand automobile rows across the continent, and, on the other, he did not<br/>trouble to conceal an old-time salesman’s skepticism about such things as analyzing the sex and status<br/>of automobiles, a pursuit he characterized by saying, “When I play pool, I like to keep one foot on the<br/>floor.” Still, he knew how to sell cars, and that was what the Edsel Division needed. Recalling how<br/>he and his sales staff brought off the unlikely trick of persuading substantial and reputable men who<br/>had already achieved success in one of the toughest of all businesses to tear up profitable franchises<br/>in favor of a risky new one, Doyle said not long ago, “As soon as the first few new Edsels came<br/>through,early in 1957, we put a couple of them in each of our five regional sales offices. Needless to<br/>say, we kept those offices locked and the blinds drawn. Dealers in every make for miles around<br/>wanted to see the car, if only out of curiosity, and that gave us the leverage we needed. We let it be<br/>known that we would show the car only to dealers who were really interested in coming with us, and<br/>then we sent our regional field managers out to surrounding towns to try to line up the No. 1 dealer in<br/>each to see the cars. If we couldn’t get No. 1, we’d try for No. 2. Anyway, we set things up so that no<br/>one got in to see the Edsel without listening to a complete one-hour pitch on the whole situation by a</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark47"><span>member of our sales force. It worked very well.” It worked so well that by midsummer, 1957, it was<br/>clear that Edsel was going to have a lot of quality dealers on Introduction Day. (In fact, it missed the<br/>goal of twelve hundred by a couple of dozen.) Indeed, some dealers in other makes were apparently<br/>so confident of the Edsel’s success, or so bemused by the Doyle staff’s pitch, that they were entirely<br/>willing to sign up after hardly more than a glance at the Edsel itself. Doyle’s people urged them to<br/>study the car closely, and kept reciting the litany of its virtues, but the prospective Edsel dealers<br/>would wave such protestations aside and demand a contract without further ado. In retrospect, it<br/>would seem that Doyle could have given lessons to the Pied Piper.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Now that the Edsel was no longer the exclusive concern of Dearborn, the Ford Company was<br/>irrevocably committed to going ahead. “Until Doyle went into action, the whole program could have<br/>been quietly dropped at any time at a word from top management, but once the dealers had been<br/>signed up, there was the matter of honoring your contract to put out a car,” Krafve has explained. The<br/>matter was attended to with dispatch. Early in June, 1957, the company announced that of the $250<br/>million it had set aside to defray the advance costs of the Edsel, $150 million was being spent on<br/>basic facilities, including the conversion of various Ford and Mercury plants to the needs of<br/>producing the new cars; $50 million on special Edsel tooling; and $50 million on initial advertising<br/>and promotion. In June, too, an Edsel destined to be the star of a television commercial for future<br/>release was stealthily transported in a closed van to Hollywood, where, on a locked sound stage<br/>patrolled by security guards, it was exposed to the cameras in the admiring presence of a few<br/>carefully chosen actors who had sworn that their lips would be sealed from then until Introduction<br/>Day. For this delicate photographic operation the Edsel Division cannily enlisted the services of<br/>Cascade Pictures, which also worked for the Atomic Energy Commission, and, as far as is known,<br/>there were no unintentional leaks. “We took all the same precautions we take for our A.E.C. films,” a<br/>grim Cascade official has since said.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark48"><span>Within a few weeks, the Edsel Division had eighteen hundred salaried employees and was rapidly<br/>filling  some fifteen thousand factory jobs in the newly converted plants. On July 15th, Edsels began<br/>rolling off assembly lines at Somerville, Massachusetts; Mahwah, New Jersey; Louisville, Kentucky;<br/>and San Jose, California. The same day, Doyle scored an important coup by signing up Charles<br/>Kreisler, a Manhattan dealer regarded as one of the country’s foremost practitioners in his field, who<br/>had represented Oldsmobile—one of Edsel’s self-designated rivals—before heeding the siren song<br/>from Dearborn. On July 22nd, the first advertisement for the Edsel appeared—in </span></a><i>Life</i><span>. A two-page<br/>spread in plain black-and-white, it was impeccably classic and calm, showing a car whooshing down<br/>a country highway at such high speed that it was an indistinguishable blur. “Lately, some mysterious<br/>automobiles have been seen on the roads,” the accompanying text was headed. It went on to say that<br/>the blur was an Edsel being road-tested, and concluded with the assurance “The Edsel is on its way.”<br/>Two weeks later, a second ad appeared in </span><i>Life</i><span>, this one showing a ghostly-looking car, covered with<br/>a white sheet, standing at the entrance to the Ford styling center. This time the headline read, “A man<br/>in your town recently made a decision that will change his life.” The decision, it was explained, was<br/>to become an Edsel dealer. Whoever wrote the ad cannot have known how truly he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DURING <span class="p">the tense summer of 1957, the man of the hour at Edsel was C. Gayle Warnock, director of<br/>public relations, whose duty was not so much to generate public interest in the forthcoming product,<br/>there being an abundance of that, as to keep the interest at white heat, and readily convertible into a<br/>desire to buy one of the new cars on or after Introduction Day—or, as the company came to call it,<br/>Edsel Day. Warnock, a dapper, affable man with a tiny mustache, is a native of Converse, Indiana,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark49"><span>who, long before Krafve drafted him from the Ford office in Chicago, did a spot of publicity work for<br/>county fairs—a background that has enabled him to spice the honeyed smoothness of the modern<br/>public-relations man with a touch of the old carnival pitchman’s uninhibited spirit. Recalling his<br/>summons to Dearborn, Warnock says, “When Dick Krafve hired me, back in the fall of 1955, he told<br/>me, ‘I want you to program the E-Car publicity from now to Introduction Day.’ I said, ‘Frankly, Dick,<br/>what do you mean by “program”?’ He said he meant to sort of space it out, starting at the end and<br/>working backward. This was something new to me—I was used to taking what breaks I could get<br/>when I could get them—but I soon found out how right Dick was. It was almost too easy to get<br/>publicity for the Edsel. Early in 1956, when it was still called the E-Car, Krafve gave a little talk<br/>about it out in Portland, Oregon. We didn’t try for anything more than a play in the local press, but the<br/>wire services picked the story up and it went out all over the country. Clippings came in by the<br/>bushel. Right then I realized the trouble we might be headed for. The public was getting to be<br/>hysterical to see our car, figuring it was going to be some kind of dream car—like nothing they’d ever<br/>seen. I said to Krafve, ‘When they find out it’s got four wheels and one engine, just like the next car,<br/>they’re liable to be disappointed.’”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It was agreed that the safest way to tread the tightrope between overplaying and underplaying the<br/>Edsel would be to say nothing about the car as a whole but to reveal its individual charms a little at a<br/>time—a sort of automotive strip tease (a phrase that Warnock couldn’t with proper dignity use<br/>himself but was happy to see the </span><i>New York Times </i><span>use for him). The policy was later violated now<br/>and then, purposely or inadvertently. For one thing, as the pre-Edsel Day summer wore on, reporters<br/>prevailed upon Krafve to authorize Warnock to show the Edsel to them, one at a time, on what<br/>Warnock called a “peekaboo,” or “you’ve-seen-it-now-forget-it,” basis. And, for another, Edsels<br/>loaded on vans for delivery to dealers were appearing on the highways in ever-increasing numbers,<br/>covered fore and aft with canvas flaps that, as if to whet the desire of the motoring public, were<br/>forever blowing loose. That summer, too, was a time of speechmaking by an Edsel foursome<br/>consisting of Krafve, Doyle, J. Emmet Judge, who was Edsel’s director of merchandise and product<br/>planning, and Robert F. G. Copeland, its assistant general sales manager for advertising, sales<br/>promotion, and training. Ranging separately up and down and across the nation, the four orators<br/>moved around so fast and so tirelessly that Warnock, lest he lose track of them, took to indicating<br/>their whereabouts with colored pins on a map in his office. “Let’s see, Krafve goes from Atlanta to<br/>New Orleans, Doyle from Council Bluffs to Salt Lake City,” Warnock would muse of a morning in<br/>Dearborn, sipping his second cup of coffee and then getting up to yank the pins out and jab them in<br/>again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark50"><span>Although most of Krafve’s audiences consisted of bankers and representatives of finance<br/>companies who it was hoped would lend money to Edsel dealers, his speeches that summer, far from<br/>echoing the general hoopla, were almost statesmanlike in their cautious—even somber—references to<br/>the new car’s prospects. And well they might have been, for developments in the general economic<br/>outlook of the nation were making more sanguine men than Krafve look puzzled. In July, 1957, the<br/>stock market went into a nose dive, marking the beginning of what is recalled as the recession of<br/>1958. Then, early in August, a decline in the sales of medium-priced 1957 cars of all makes set in,<br/>and the general situation worsened so rapidly that, before the month was out, </span></a><i>Automotive News</i><span>reported that dealers in all makes were ending their season with the second-largest number of unsold<br/>new cars in history. If Krafve, on his lonely rounds, ever considered retreating to Dearborn for<br/>consolation, he was forced to put that notion out of his mind when, also in August, Mercury, Edsel’s<br/>own stablemate, served notice that it was going to make things as tough as possible for the newcomer</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>by undertaking a million-dollar, thirty-day advertising drive aimed especially at “price-conscious<br/>buyers”—a clear reference to the fact that the 1957 Mercury, which was then being sold at a discount<br/>by most dealers, cost less than the new Edsel was expected to. Meanwhile, sales of the Rambler,<br/>which was the only American-made small car then in production, were beginning to rise ominously.<br/>In the face of all these evil portents, Krafve fell into the habit of ending his speeches with a rather<br/>downbeat anecdote about the board chairman of an unsuccessful dog-food company who said to his<br/>fellow directors, “Gentlemen, let’s face facts—dogs don’t like our product.” “As far as we’re<br/>concerned,” Krafve added on at least one occasion, driving home the moral with admirable clarity, “a<br/>lot will depend on whether people like our car or not.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark51"><span>But most of the other Edsel men were unimpressed by Krafve’s misgivings. Perhaps the least<br/>impressed of all was Judge, who, while doing his bit as an itinerant speaker, specialized in<br/>community and civic groups. Undismayed by the limitations of the strip-tease policy, Judge<br/>brightened up his lectures by showing such a bewildering array of animated graphs, cartoons, charts,<br/>and pictures of parts of the car—all flashed on a CinemaScope screen—that his listeners usually got<br/>halfway home before they realized that he hadn’t shown them an Edsel. He wandered restlessly<br/>around the auditorium as he spoke, shifting the kaleidoscopic images on the screen at will with the aid<br/>of an automatic slide changer—a trick made possible by a crew of electricians who laced the place in<br/>advance with a maze of wires linking the device to dozens of floor switches, which, scattered about<br/>the hall, responded when he kicked them. Each of the “Judge spectaculars,” as these performances<br/>came to be known, cost the Edsel Division five thousand dollars—a sum that included the pay and<br/>expenses of the technical crew, who would arrive on the scene a day or so ahead of time to set up the<br/>electrical rig. At the last moment, Judge would descend melodramatically on the town by plane,<br/>hasten to the hall, and go into his act. “One of the greatest aspects of this whole Edsel program is the<br/>philosophy of product and merchandising behind it,” Judge might start off, with a desultory kick at a<br/>switch here, a switch there. “All of us who have been a part of it are real proud of this background<br/>and we are anxiously awaiting its success when the car is introduced this fall.… Never again will we<br/>be associated with anything as gigantic and full of meaning as this particular program.… Here is a<br/>glimpse of the car which will be before the American public on September 4, 1957 [at this point,<br/>Judge would show a provocative slide of a hubcap or section of fender].… It is a different car in<br/>every respect, yet it has an element of conservatism which will give it maximum appeal.… The<br/>distinctiveness of the frontal styling integrates with the sculptured patterns of the side treatment.…”<br/>And on and on Judge would rhapsodize, rolling out such awesome phrases as “sculptured sheet<br/>metal,” “highlight character,” and “graceful, flowing lines.” At last would come the ringing<br/>peroration. “We are proud of the Edsel!” he would cry, kicking switches right and left. “When it is<br/>introduced this fall, it will take its place on the streets and highways of America, bringing new<br/>greatness to the Ford Motor Company. This is the Edsel story.”</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark52"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>drum-roll climax of the strip tease was a three-day press preview of the Edsel, undraped from<br/>pinched-in snout to flaring rear, that was held in Detroit and Dearborn on August 26th, 27th, and 28th,<br/>with 250 reporters from all over the country in attendance. It differed from previous automotive<br/>jamborees of its kind in that the journalists were invited to bring their wives along—and many of<br/>them did. Before it was over, it had cost the Ford Company ninety thousand dollars. Grand as it was,<br/>the conventionality of its setting was a disappointment to Warnock, who had proposed, and seen<br/>rejected, three locales that he thought would provide a more offbeat </span><i>ambiance</i><span>—a steamer on the<br/>Detroit River (“wrong symbolism”); Edsel, Kentucky (“inaccessible by road”); and Haiti (“just</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>turned down flat”). Thus hobbled, Warnock could do no better for the reporters and their wives when<br/>they converged on the Detroit scene on Sunday evening, August 25th, than to put them up at the<br/>discouragingly named Sheraton-Cadillac Hotel and to arrange for them to spend Monday afternoon<br/>hearing and reading about the long-awaited details of the entire crop of Edsels—eighteen varieties<br/>available, in four main lines (Corsair, Citation, Pacer, and Ranger), differing mainly in their size,<br/>power, and trim. The  next morning, specimens of the models themselves were  revealed to the<br/>reporters in the styling center’s rotunda, and Henry II offered a few words of tribute to his father.<br/>“The wives were not asked to the unveiling,” a Foote, Cone man who helped plan the affair recalls.<br/>“It was too solemn and businesslike an event for that. It went over fine. There was excitement even<br/>among the hardened newspapermen.” (The import of the stories that most of the excited<br/>newspapermen filed was that the Edsel seemed to be a good car, though not so radical as its billing<br/>had suggested.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark53"><span>In the afternoon, the reporters were whisked out to the test track to see a team of stunt drivers put<br/>the Edsel through its paces. This event, calculated to be thrilling, turned out to be hair-raising, and<br/>even, for some, a little unstringing. Enjoined not to talk too much about speed and horsepower, since<br/>only a few months previously the whole automobile industry had nobly resolved to concentrate on<br/>making cars instead of delayed-action bombs, Warnock had decided to emphasize the Edsel’s<br/>liveliness through deeds rather than words, and to accomplish this he had hired a team of stunt<br/>drivers. Edsels ran over two-foot ramps on two wheels, bounced from higher ramps on all four<br/>wheels, were driven in crisscross patterns, grazing each other, at sixty or seventy miles per hour, and<br/>skidded into complete turns at fifty. For comic relief, there was a clown driver parodying the<br/>daredevil stuff. All the while, the voice of Neil L. Blume, Edsel’s engineering chief, could be heard<br/>on a loudspeaker, purring about “the capabilities, the safety, the ruggedness, the maneuverability and<br/>performance of these new cars,” and skirting the words “speed” and “horsepower” as delicately as a<br/>sandpiper skirts a wave. At one point, when an Edsel leaping a high ramp just missed turning over,<br/>Krafve’s face took on a ghastly pallor; he later reported that he had not known the daredevil stunts<br/>were going to be so extreme, and was concerned both for the good name of the Edsel and the lives of<br/>the drivers. Warnock, noticing his boss’s distress, went over and asked Krafve if he was enjoying the<br/>show. Krafve replied tersely that he would answer when it was over and all hands safe. But everyone<br/>else seemed to be having a grand time. The Foote, Cone man said, “You looked over this green<br/>Michigan hill, and there were those glorious Edsels, performing gloriously in unison. It was beautiful.<br/>It was like the Rockettes. It was exciting. Morale was high.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Warnock’s high spirits had carried him to even wilder extremes of fancy. The stunt driving, like the<br/>unveiling, was considered too rich for the blood of the wives, but the resourceful Warnock was ready<br/>for them with a fashion show that he hoped they would find at least equally diverting. He need not<br/>have worried. The star of the show, who was introduced by Brown, the Edsel stylist, as a Paris<br/></span><i>couturière</i><span>, both beautiful and talented, turned out at the final curtain to be a female impersonator—a<br/>fact of which Warnock, to heighten the verisimilitude of the act, had given Brown no advance<br/>warning. Things were never again quite the same since between Brown and Warnock, but the wives<br/>were able to give their husbands an extra paragraph or two for their stories.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark54"><span>That evening, there was a big gala for one and all at the styling center, which was itself styled as a<br/>night club for the occasion, complete with a fountain that danced in time with the music of Ray<br/>McKinley’s band, whose emblem, the letters “GM”—a holdover from the days of its founder, the late<br/>Glenn Miller—was emblazoned, as usual, on the music stand of each musician, very nearly ruining<br/>the evening for Warnock. The next morning, at a windup press conference held by Ford officials.</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Breech declared of the Edsel, “It’s a husky youngster, and, like most other new parents, we’re proud<br/>enough to pop our buttons.” Then seventy-one of the reporters took the wheels of as many Edsels and<br/>set out for home—not to drive the cars into their garages but to deliver them to the showrooms of their<br/>local Edsel dealers. Let Warnock describe the highlights of this final flourish: “There were several<br/>unfortunate occurrences. One guy simply miscalculated and cracked up his car running into something.<br/>No fault of the Edsel </span><i>there</i><span>. One car lost its oil pan, so naturally the motor froze. It can happen to the<br/>best of cars. Fortunately, at the time of this malfunction the driver was going through a beautiful-<br/>sounding town—Paradise, Kansas, I think it was—and that gave the news reports about it a nice little<br/>positive touch. The nearest dealer gave the reporter a new Edsel, and he drove on home, climbing<br/>Pikes Peak on the way. Then one car crashed through a tollgate when the brakes failed. That was bad.<br/>It’s funny, but the thing we were most worried about—other drivers being so eager to get a look at the<br/>Edsels that they’d crowd our cars off the road—happened only once. That was on the Pennsylvania<br/>Turnpike. One of our reporters was tooling along—no problems—when a Plymouth driver pulled up<br/>alongside to rubberneck, and edged so close that the Edsel got sideswiped. Minor damage.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark55"><span class="s6">LATE </span></a>in 1959, immediately after the demise of the Edsel, <i>Business Week </i><span>stated that at the big press<br/>preview a Ford executive had said to a reporter, “If the company weren’t in so deep, we never would<br/>have brought it out now.” However, since </span><i>Business Week </i><span>neglected to publish this patently<br/>sensational statement for over two years, and since to this day all the former ranking Edsel executives<br/>(Krafve included, notwithstanding his preoccupation with the luckless dog-food company) firmly<br/>maintained that right up to Edsel Day and even for a short time thereafter they expected the Edsel to<br/>succeed, it would seem that the quotation should be regarded as a highly suspect archaeological find.<br/>Indeed, during the period between the press preview and Edsel Day the spirit of everybody<br/>associated with the venture seems to have been one of wild optimism. “Oldsmobile, Goodbye!” ran<br/>the headline on an ad, in the Detroit </span><i>Free Press</i><span>, for an agency that was switching from Olds to Edsel.<br/>A dealer in Portland, Oregon, reported that he had already sold two Edsels, sight unseen. Warnock<br/>dug up a fireworks company in Japan willing to make him, at nine dollars apiece, five thousand<br/>rockets that, exploding in mid-air, would release nine-foot scale-model Edsels made of rice paper<br/>that would inflate and descend like parachutes; his head reeling with visions of filling America’s<br/>skies as well as its highways with Edsels on Edsel Day, Warnock was about to dash off an order<br/>when Krafve, looking something more than puzzled, shook his head.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On September 3rd—E Day-minus-one—the prices of the various Edsel models were announced;<br/>for cars delivered to New York they ran from just under $2,800 to just over $4,100. On E Day, the<br/>Edsel arrived. In Cambridge, a band led a gleaming motorcade of the new cars up Massachusetts<br/>Avenue; flying out of Richmond, California, a helicopter hired by one of the most jubilant of the<br/>dealers lassoed by Doyle spread a giant Edsel sign above San Francisco Bay; and all over the nation,<br/>from the Louisiana bayous to the peak of Mount Rainier to the Maine woods, one needed only a radio<br/>or a television set to know that the very air, despite Warnock’s setback on the rockets, was quivering<br/>with the presence of the Edsel. The tone for Edsel Day’s blizzard of publicity was set by an ad,<br/>published in newspapers all over the country, in which the Edsel shared the spotlight with the Ford<br/>Company’s President Ford and Chairman Breech. In the ad, Ford looked like a dignified young father,<br/>Breech like a dignified gentleman holding a full house against a possible straight, the Edsel just<br/>looked like an Edsel. The accompanying text declared that the decision to produce the car had been<br/>“based on what we knew, guessed, felt, believed, suspected—about you,” and added, “YOU are the<br/>reason behind the Edsel.” The tone was calm and confident. There did not seem to be much room for</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">doubt about the reality of that full house.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Before sundown, it was estimated, 2,850,000 people had seen the new car in dealers’ showrooms.<br/>Three days later, in North Philadelphia, an Edsel was stolen. It can reasonably be argued that the<br/>crime marked the high-water mark of public acceptance of the Edsel; only a few months later, any but<br/>the least fastidious of car thieves might not have bothered.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">DECLINE AND FALL</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THE <span class="p">most striking physical characteristic of the Edsel was, of course, its radiator grille. This, in<br/>contrast to the wide and horizontal grilles of all nineteen other American makes of the time, was<br/>slender and vertical. Of chromium-plated steel, and shaped something like an egg, it sat in the middle<br/>of the car’s front end, and was embellished by the word </span>“EDSEL” <span class="p">in aluminum letters running down its<br/>length. It was intended to suggest the front end of practically any car of twenty or thirty years ago and<br/>of most contemporary European cars, and thus to look at once seasoned and sophisticated. The<br/>trouble was that whereas the front ends of the antiques and the European cars were themselves high<br/>and narrow—consisting, indeed, of little more than the radiator grilles—the front end of the Edsel<br/>was broad and low, just like the front ends of all its American competitors. Consequently, there were<br/>wide areas on either side of the grille that had to be filled in with something, and filled in they were</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—with twin panels of entirely conventional horizontal chrome grillwork. The effect was that of an<br/>Oldsmobile with the prow of a Pierce-Arrow implanted in its front end, or, more metaphorically, of<br/>the charwoman trying on the duchess’ necklace. The attempt at sophistication was so transparent as to<br/>be endearing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark56"><span>But if the grille of the Edsel appealed through guilelessness, the rear end was another matter. Here,<br/>too, there was a marked departure from the conventional design of the day. Instead of the notorious<br/>tail fin, the car had what looked to its fanciers like wings and to others, less ethereal-minded, like<br/>eyebrows. The lines of the trunk lid and the rear fenders, swooping upward and outward, did<br/>somewhat resemble the wings of a gull in flight, but the resemblance was marred by two long, narrow<br/>tail lights, set partly in the trunk lid and partly in the fenders, which followed those lines and created<br/>the startling illusion, especially at night, of a slant-eyed grin. From the front, the Edsel seemed, above<br/>all, anxious to please, even at the cost of being clownish; from the rear it looked crafty, Oriental,<br/>smug, one-up—maybe a little cynical and contemptuous, too. It was as if, somewhere between grille<br/>and rear fenders, a sinister personality change had taken place.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In other respects, the exterior styling of the Edsel was not far out of the ordinary. Its sides were<br/>festooned with a bit less than the average amount of chrome, and distinguished by a gouged-out bullet-<br/>shaped groove extending forward from the rear fender for about half the length of the car. Midway<br/>along this groove, the word </span><span class="s6">“EDSEL” </span><span>was displayed in chrome letters, and just below the rear window<br/>was a small grille-like decoration, on which was spelled out—of all things—</span><span class="s11">“EDSEL.”</span><span class="s6"> </span><span>(After all,<br/>hadn’t Stylist Brown declared his intention to create a vehicle that would be “readily recognizable”?)<br/>In its interior, the Edsel strove mightily to live up to the prediction of General Manager Krafve that<br/>the car would be “the epitome of the push-button era.” The push-button era in medium-priced cars<br/>being what it was, Krafve’s had been a rash prophecy indeed, but the Edsel rose to it with a devilish<br/>assemblage of gadgets such as had seldom, if ever, been seen before. On or near the Edsel’s<br/>dashboard were a push button that popped the trunk lid open; a lever that popped the hood open; a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark57"><span>lever that released the parking brake; a speedometer that glowed red when the driver exceeded his<br/>chosen maximum speed; a single-dial control for both heating and cooling; a tachometer, in the best<br/>racing-car style; buttons to operate or regulate the lights, the height of the radio antenna, the heater-<br/>blower, the windshield wiper, and the cigarette lighter; and a row of eight red lights to wink warnings<br/>that the engine was too hot, that it wasn’t hot enough, that the generator was on the blink, that the<br/>parking brake was on, that a door was open, that the oil pressure was low, that the oil level was low,<br/>and that the gasoline level was low, the last of which the skeptical driver could confirm by consulting<br/>the gas gauge, mounted a few inches away. Epitomizing this epitome, the automatic-transmission<br/>control box—arrestingly situated on top of the steering post, in the center of the wheel—sprouted a<br/>galaxy of five push buttons so light to the touch that, as Edsel men could hardly be restrained from<br/>demonstrating, they could be depressed with a toothpick.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Of the four lines of Edsels, both of the two larger and more expensive ones—the Corsair and the<br/>Citation—were 219 inches long, or two inches longer than the biggest of the Oldsmobiles; both were<br/>eighty inches wide, or about as wide as passenger cars ever get; and the height of both was only fifty-<br/>seven inches, as low as any other medium-priced car. The Ranger and the Pacer, the smaller Edsels,<br/>were six inches shorter, an inch narrower, and an inch lower than the Corsair and the Citation. The<br/>Corsair and the Citation were equipped with 345-horsepower engines, making them more powerful<br/>than any other American car at the time of their debut, and the Ranger and the Pacer were good for<br/>303 horsepower, near the top in their class. At the touch of a toothpick to the “Drive” button, an idling<br/>Corsair or Citation sedan (more than two tons of car, in either case) could, if properly skippered, take<br/>off with such abruptness that in ten and three-tenths seconds it would be doing a mile a minute, and in<br/>seventeen and a half seconds it would be a quarter of a mile down the road. If anything or anybody<br/>happened to be in the way when the toothpick touched the push button, so much the worse.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark58"><span class="s6">WHEN </span></a><span>the wraps were taken off the Edsel, it received what is known in the theatrical business as a<br/>mixed press. The automotive editors of the daily newspapers stuck mostly to straight descriptions of<br/>the car, with only here and there a phrase or two of appraisal, some of it ambiguous (“The difference<br/>in style is spectacular,” noted Joseph C. Ingraham in the </span><i>New York Times </i><span>) and some of it openly<br/>favorable (“A handsome and hard-punching newcomer,” said Fred Olmstead, in the Detroit </span><i>Free</i>). Magazine criticism was generally more exhaustive and occasionally more severe. <i>Motor</i><span>, the largest monthly devoted to ordinary automobiles, as distinct from hot rods, devoted eight<br/>pages of its October, 1957, issue to an analysis and critique of the Edsel by Joe H. Wherry, its Detroit<br/>editor. Wherry liked the car’s appearance, its interior comfort, and its gadgets, although he did not<br/>always make it clear just why; in paying his respects to the transmission buttons on the steering post,<br/>he wrote, “You need not take your eyes off the road for an instant.” He conceded that there were<br/>“untold opportunities for more … unique approaches,” but he summed up his opinion in a sentence<br/>that fairly peppered the Edsel with honorific adverbs: “The Edsel performs fine, rides well, and<br/>handles good.” Tom McCahill, of </span><i>Mechanix Illustrated</i><span>, generally admired the “bolt bag,” as he<br/>affectionately called the Edsel, but he had some reservations, which, incidentally, throw some<br/>interesting light on an automobile critic’s equivalent of an aisle seat. “On ribbed concrete,” he<br/>reported, “every time I shot the throttle to the floor quickly, the wheels spun like a gone-wild Waring<br/>Blendor.… At high speeds, especially through rough corners, I found the suspension a little too<br/>horsebacky.… I couldn’t help but wonder what this salami would really do if it had enough road<br/>adhesion.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By far the most downright—and very likely the most damaging—panning that the Edsel got during</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">its first months appeared in the January, 1958, issue of the Consumers Union monthly, <i>Consumer</i><span>, whose 800,000 subscribers probably included more potential Edsel buyers than have ever<br/>turned the pages of </span><i>Motor Trend </i>or <i>Mechanix Illustrated</i><span>. After having put a Corsair through a series<br/>of road tests, </span><i>Consumer Reports </i>declared:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark59"><span>The Edsel has no important basic advantages over other brands. The car is almost entirely conventional in construction.… The amount of<br/>shake present in this Corsair body on rough roads—which wasn’t long in making itself heard as squeaks and rattles—went well beyond<br/>any acceptable limit.… The Corsair’s handling qualities—sluggish, over-slow steering, sway and lean on turns, and a general detached-<br/>from-the-road feel—are, to put it mildly, without distinction. As a matter of, simple fact, combined with the car’s tendency to shake like<br/>jelly, Edsel handling represents retrogression rather than progress.… Stepping on the gas in traffic, or in passing cars, or just to feel the<br/>pleasurable surge of power, will cause those big cylinders really to lap up fuel.… The center of the steering wheel is not, in CU’s opinion,<br/>a good pushbutton location.… To look at the Edsel buttons pulls the driver’s eyes clear down off the road. [</span></a><i>Pace </i><span>Mr. Wherry.] The<br/>“luxury-loaded” Edsel—as one magazine cover described it—will certainly please anyone who confuses gadgetry with true luxury.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Three months later, in a roundup of all the 1958-model cars, <i>Consumer Reports </i><span>went at the Edsel<br/>again, calling it “more uselessly overpowered … more gadget bedecked, more hung with expensive<br/>accessories than any car in its price class,” and giving the Corsair and the Citation the bottom<br/>position in its competitive ratings. Like Krafve, </span><i>Consumer Reports </i><span>considered the Edsel an epitome;<br/>unlike Krafve, the magazine concluded that the car seemed to “epitomize the many excesses” with<br/>which Detroit manufacturers were “repulsing more and more potential car buyers.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AND <span class="p">yet, in a way, the Edsel wasn’t so bad. It embodied much of the spirit of its time—or at least of<br/>the time when it was designed, early in 1955. It was clumsy, powerful, dowdy, gauche, well-meaning</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark60"><span>—a de Kooning woman. Few people, apart from employees of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, who were<br/>paid to do so, have adequately hymned its ability, at its best, to coax and jolly the harried owner into<br/>a sense of well-being. Furthermore, the designers of several rival makes, including Chevrolet, Buick,<br/>and Ford, Edsel’s own stablemate, later flattered Brown’s styling by imitating at least one feature of<br/>the car’s much reviled lines—the rear-end wing theme. The Edsel was obviously jinxed, but to say<br/>that it was jinxed by its design alone would be an oversimplification, as it would be to say that it was<br/>jinxed by an excess of motivational research. The fact is that in the short, unhappy life of the Edsel a<br/>number of other factors contributed to its commercial downfall. One of these was the scarcely<br/>believable circumstance that many of the very first Edsels—those obviously destined for the most<br/>glaring public limelight—were dramatically imperfect. By its preliminary program of promotion and<br/>advertising, the Ford Company had built up an overwhelming head of public interest in the Edsel,<br/>causing its arrival to be anticipated and the car itself to be gawked at with more eagerness than had<br/>ever greeted any automobile before it. After all that, it seemed, the car didn’t quite work. Within a<br/>few weeks after the Edsel was introduced, its pratfalls were the talk of the land. Edsels were<br/>delivered with oil leaks, sticking hoods, trunks that wouldn’t open, and push buttons that, far from<br/>yielding to a toothpick, couldn’t be budged with a hammer. An obviously distraught man staggered<br/>into a bar up the Hudson River, demanding a double shot without delay and exclaiming that the<br/>dashboard of his new Edsel had just burst into flame. </span></a><i>Automotive News </i><span>reported that in general the<br/>earliest Edsels suffered from poor paint, inferior sheet metal, and faulty accessories, and quoted the<br/>lament of a dealer about one of the first Edsel convertibles he received: “The top was badly set,<br/>doors cockeyed, the header bar trimmed at the wrong angle, and the front springs sagged.” The Ford<br/>Company had the particular bad luck to sell to Consumers Union—which buys its test cars in the open<br/>market, as a precaution against being favored with specially doctored samples—an Edsel in which<br/>the axle ratio was wrong, an expansion plug in the cooling system blew out, the power-steering pump</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>leaked, the rear-axle gears were noisy, and the heater emitted blasts of hot air when it was turned off.<br/>A former executive of the Edsel Division has estimated that only about half of the first Edsels really<br/>performed properly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark61"><span>A layman cannot help wondering how the Ford Company, in all its power and glory, could have<br/>been guilty of such a Mack Sennett routine of buildup and anticlimax. The wan, hard-working Krafve<br/>explains gamely that when a company brings out a new model of any make—even an old and tested<br/>one—the first cars often have bugs in them. A more startling theory—though only a theory—is that<br/>there may have been sabotage in some of the four plants that assembled the Edsel, all but one of<br/>which had previously been, and currently also were, assembling Fords or Mercurys. In marketing the<br/>Edsel, the Ford Company took a leaf out of the book of General Motors, which for years had<br/>successfully been permitting, and even encouraging, the makers and sellers of its Oldsmobiles,<br/>Buicks, Pontiacs, and the higher-priced models of its Chevrolet to fight for customers with no quarter<br/>given; faced with the same sort of intramural competition, some members of the Ford and Lincoln-<br/>Mercury Divisions of the Ford Company openly hoped from the start for the Edsel’s downfall.<br/>(Krafve, realizing what might happen, had asked that the Edsel be assembled in plants of its own, but<br/>his superiors turned him down.) However, Doyle, speaking with the authority of a veteran of the<br/>automobile business as well as with that of Krafve’s second-in-command, pooh-poohs the notion that<br/>the Edsel was the victim of dirty work at the plants. “Of course the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury<br/>Divisions didn’t want to see another Ford Company car in the field,” he says, “but as far as I know,<br/>anything they did at the executive and plant levels was in competitive good taste. On the other hand, at<br/>the distribution and dealer level, you got some rough infighting in terms of whispering and<br/>propaganda. If I’d been in one of the other divisions, I’d have done the same thing.” No proud<br/>defeated general of the old school ever spoke more nobly.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It is a tribute of sorts to the men who gave the Edsel its big buildup that although cars tending to<br/>rattle, balk, and fall apart into shiny heaps of junk kept coming off the assembly lines, things didn’t go<br/>badly at first. Doyle says that on Edsel Day more than 6,500 Edsels were either ordered by or<br/>actually delivered to customers. That was a good showing, but there were isolated signs of<br/>resistance. For instance, a New England dealer selling Edsels in one showroom and Buicks in<br/>another reported that two prospects walked into the Edsel showroom, took a look at the Edsel, and<br/>placed orders for Buicks on the spot.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark62"><span>In the next few days, sales dropped sharply, but that was to be expected once the bloom was off.<br/>Automobile deliveries to dealers—one of the important indicators in the trade—are customarily<br/>measured in ten-day periods, and during the first ten days of September, on only six of which the<br/>Edsel was on sale, it racked up 4,095; this was lower than Doyle’s first-day figure because many of<br/>the initial purchases were of models and color combinations not in stock, which had to be factory-<br/>assembled to order. The delivery total for the second ten-day period was off slightly, and that for the<br/>third was down to just under 3,600. For the first ten days of October, nine of which were business<br/>days, there were only 2,751 deliveries—an average of just over three hundred cars a day. In order to<br/>sell the 200,000 cars per year that would make the Edsel operation profitable the Ford Company<br/>would have to move an average of between six and seven hundred each business day—a good many<br/>more than three hundred a day. On the night of Sunday, October 13th, Ford put on a mammoth<br/>television spectacular for Edsel, pre-empting the time ordinarily allotted to the Ed Sullivan show, but<br/>though the program cost $400,000 and starred Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, it failed to cause any<br/>sharp spurt in sales. Now it was obvious that things were not going at all well.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the former executives of the Edsel Division, opinions differ as to the exact moment when</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark63"><span>the portents of doom became unmistakable. Krafve feels that the moment did not arrive until sometime<br/>late in October. Wallace, in his capacity as Edsel’s pipe-smoking semi-Brain Truster, goes a step<br/>further by pinning the start of the disaster to a specific date—October 4th, the day the first Soviet<br/>sputnik went into orbit, shattering the myth of American technical pre-eminence and precipitating a<br/>public revulsion against Detroit’s fancier baubles. Public Relations Director Warnock maintains that<br/>his barometric sensitivity to the public temper enabled him to call the turn as early as mid-September;<br/>contrariwise, Doyle says he maintained his optimism until mid-November, by which time he was<br/>about      the only man in the division who had not concluded it would take a miracle to save the Edsel.<br/>“In November,” says Wallace, sociologically, “there was panic, and its concomitant—mob action.”<br/>The mob action took the form of a concerted tendency to blame the design of the car for the whole<br/>debacle; Edsel men who had previously had nothing but lavish praise for the radiator grille and rear<br/>end now went around muttering that any fool could see they were ludicrous. The obvious sacrificial<br/>victim was Brown, whose stock had gone through the roof at the time of the regally accoladed debut<br/>of his design, in August, 1955. Now, without having done anything further, for either better or worse,<br/>the poor fellow became the company scapegoat. “Beginning in November, nobody talked to Roy,”<br/>Wallace says. On November 27th, as if things weren’t bad enough, Charles Kreisler, who as the only<br/>Edsel dealer in Manhattan provided its prize showcase, announced that he was turning in his<br/>franchise because of poor sales, and it was rumored that he added, “The Ford Motor Company has<br/>laid an egg.” He thereupon signed up with American Motors to sell its Rambler, which, as the only<br/>domestic small car then on the market, was already the possessor of a zooming sales curve. Doyle<br/>grimly commented that the Edsel Division was “not concerned” about Kreisler’s defection.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark64"><span>By December, the panic at Edsel had abated to the point where its sponsors could pull themselves<br/>together and begin casting about for ways to get sales moving again. Henry Ford II, manifesting<br/>himself to Edsel dealers on closed-circuit television, urged them to remain calm, promised that the<br/>company would back them to the limit, and said flatly, “The Edsel is here to stay.” A million and a<br/>half letters went out over Krafve’s signature to owners of medium-priced cars, asking them to drop<br/>around at their local dealers and test-ride the Edsel; everyone doing so, Krafve promised, would be<br/>given an eight-inch plastic scale model of the car, whether he bought a full-size one or not. The Edsel<br/>Division picked up the check for the scale models—a symptom of desperation indeed, for under<br/>normal circumstances no automobile manufacturer would make even a move to outfumble its dealers<br/>for such a tab. (Up to that time, the dealers had paid for everything, as is customary.) The division<br/>also began offering its dealers what it called “sales bonuses,” which meant that the dealers could<br/>knock anything from one hundred to three hundred dollars off the price of each car without reducing<br/>their profit margin. Krafve told a reporter that sales up to then were about what he had expected them<br/>to be, although not what he had hoped they would be; in his zeal not to seem unpleasantly surprised,<br/>he appeared to be saying that he had expected the Edsel to fail. The Edsel’s advertising campaign,<br/>which had started with studied dignity, began to sound a note of stridency. “Everyone who has seen it<br/>knows—with us—that the Edsel is a success,” a magazine ad declared, and in a later ad this phrase<br/>was twice repeated, like an incantation: “The Edsel is a success. It is a new idea—a </span></a><span class="s6">YOU </span><span>idea—on<br/>the American Road.… The Edsel is a success.” Soon the even less high-toned but more dependable<br/>advertising themes of price and social status began to intrude, in such sentences as “They’ll know<br/>you’ve </span><i>arrived </i><span>when you drive up in an Edsel” and “The one that’s really new is the lowest-priced,<br/>too!” In the more rarefied sectors of Madison Avenue, a resort to rhymed slogans is usually regarded<br/>as an indication of artistic depravity induced by commercial necessity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">From the frantic and costly measures the Edsel Division took in December, it garnered one tiny</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>crumb: for the first ten-day period of 1958, it was able to report, sales were up 18.6 percent over<br/>those of the last ten days of 1957. The catch, as the </span><i>Wall Street Journal </i><span>alertly noted, was that the<br/>latter period embraced one more selling day than the earlier one, so, for practical purposes, there had<br/>scarcely been a gain at all. In any case, that early-January word of meretricious cheer turned out to be<br/>the Edsel Division’s last gesture. On January 14, 1958, the Ford Motor Company announced that it<br/>was consolidating the Edsel Division with the Lincoln-Mercury Division to form a Mercury-Edsel-<br/>Lincoln Division, under the management of James J. Nance, who had been running Lincoln-Mercury.<br/>It was the first time that one of the major automobile companies had lumped three divisions into one<br/>since General Motors’ merger of Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac back in the depression, and to the<br/>people of the expunged Edsel Division the meaning of the administrative move was all too clear.<br/>“With that much competition in a division, the Edsel wasn’t going anywhere,” Doyle says. “It became<br/>a stepchild.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">FOR </span><span>the last year and ten months of its existence, the Edsel was very much a stepchild—generally<br/>neglected, little advertised, and kept alive only to avoid publicizing a boner any more than necessary<br/>and in the forlorn hope that it </span><i>might </i><span>go somewhere after all. What advertising it did get strove<br/>quixotically to assure the automobile trade that everything was dandy; in mid-February an ad in<br/></span><i>Automotive News </i>had Nance saying,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>Since the formation of the new M-E-L Division at Ford Motor Company, we have analyzed with keen interest the sales progress of the<br/>Edsel. We think it is quite significant that during the five months since the Edsel was introduced, Edsel sales have been greater than the<br/>first five months’ sales for any other new make of car ever introduced on the American Road.… Edsel’s steady progress can be a<br/>source of satisfaction and a great incentive to all of us.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Nance’s comparison, however, was almost meaningless, no new make ever having been introduced<br/>anything like so grandiosely, and the note of confidence could not help ringing hollow.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It is quite possible that Nance’s attention was never called to an article by S. I. Hayakawa, the<br/>semanticist, that was published in the spring of 1958 in </span><i>ETC: A Review of General Semantics</i><span>, a<br/>quarterly magazine, under the title, “Why the Edsel Laid an Egg.” Hayakawa, who was both the<br/>founder and the editor of </span><i>ETC</i><span>, explained in an introductory note that he considered the subject within<br/>the purview of general semantics because automobiles, like words, are “important … symbols in<br/>American culture,” and went on to argue that the Edsel’s flop could be attributed to Ford Company<br/>executives who had been “listening too long to the motivation-research people” and who, in their<br/>efforts to turn out a car that would satisfy customers’ sexual fantasies and the like, had failed to<br/>supply reasonable and practical transportation, thereby neglecting “the reality principle.” “What the<br/>motivation researchers failed to tell their clients … is that </span><i>only </i><span>the psychotic and the gravely neurotic<br/></span><i>act out </i><span>their irrationalities and their compensatory fantasies,” Hayakawa admonished Detroit briskly,<br/>and added, “The trouble with selling symbolic gratification via such expensive items as … the Edsel<br/>Hermaphrodite … is the competition offered by much cheaper forms of symbolic gratification, such<br/>as </span><i>Playboy </i>(fifty cents a copy), <i>Astounding Science Fiction </i><span>(thirty-five cents a copy), and television<br/>(free).”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark65">Notwithstanding the competition from </a><i>Playboy</i><span>, or possibly because the symbol-motivated public<br/>included people who could afford both, the Edsel kept rolling—but just barely. The car moved, as<br/>salesmen say, though hardly at the touch of a toothpick. In fact, as a stepchild it sold about as well as<br/>it had sold as a favorite son, suggesting that all the hoopla, whether about symbolic gratification or<br/>mere horsepower, had had little effect one way or the other. The new Edsels that were registered</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark66"><span>with the motor-vehicle bureaus of the various states during 1958 numbered 34,481—considerably<br/>fewer than new cars of any competing make, and less than one-fifth of the 200,000 a year necessary if<br/>the Edsel was to show a profit, but still representing an investment by motorists of over a hundred<br/>million dollars. The picture actually brightened in November, 1958, with the advent of the Edsel’s<br/>second-year models. Shorter by up to eight inches, lighter by up to five hundred pounds, and with<br/>engines less potent by as much as 158 horsepower, they had a price range running from five hundred<br/>to eight hundred dollars less than that of their predecessors. The vertical grille and the slant-eyed rear<br/>end were still there, but the modest power and proportions persuaded </span></a><i>Consumer Reports </i><span>to relent<br/>and say, “The Ford Motor Company, after giving last year’s initial Edsel model a black eye, has<br/>made a respectable and even likable automobile of it.” Quite a number of motorists seemed to agree;<br/>about two thousand more Edsels were sold in the first half of 1959 than had been sold in the first half<br/>of 1958, and by the early summer of 1959 the car was moving at the rate of around four thousand a<br/>month. Here, at last, was progress; sales were at almost a quarter of the minimum profitable rate,<br/>instead of a mere fifth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark67"><span>On July 1, 1959, there were 83,849 Edsels on the country’s roads. The largest number (8,344)<br/>were in California, which is perennially beset with far and away the largest number of cars of<br/>practically all makes, and the smallest number were in Alaska, Vermont, and Hawaii (122, 119, and<br/>110, respectively). All in all, the Edsel seemed to have found a niche for itself as an amusingly<br/>eccentric curiosity. Although the Ford Company, with its stockholders’ money still disappearing<br/>week after week into the Edsel, and with small cars now clearly the order of the day, could scarcely<br/>affect a sentimental approach to the subject, it nonetheless took an outside chance and, in mid-October<br/>of 1959, brought out a third series of annual models. The 1960 Edsel appeared a little more than a<br/>month after the Falcon, Ford’s first—and instantly successful—venture into the small-car field, and<br/>was scarcely an Edsel at all; gone were both the vertical grille and the horizontal rear end, and what<br/>remained looked like a cross between a Ford Fairlane and a Pontiac. Its initial sales were abysmal;<br/>by the middle of November only one plant—in Louisville, Kentucky—was still turning out Edsels,<br/>and it was turning out only about twenty a day. On November 19th, the Ford Foundation, which was<br/>planning to sell a block of its vast holdings of stock in the Ford  Motor Company, issued the<br/>prospectus that is required by law under such circumstances, and stated therein, in a footnote to a<br/>section describing the company’s products, that the Edsel had been “introduced in September 1957<br/>and discontinued in November 1959.” The same day, this mumbled admission was confirmed and<br/>amplified by a Ford Company spokesman, who did some mumbling of his own. “If we knew the<br/>reason people aren’t buying the Edsel, we’d probably have done something about it,” he said.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The final quantitative box score shows that from the beginning right up to November 19th, 110,810<br/>Edsels were produced and 109,466 were sold. (The remaining 1,344, almost all of them 1960<br/>models, were disposed of in short order with the help of drastic price cuts.) All told, only 2,846 of<br/>the 1960 Edsels were ever produced, making models of that year a potential collector’s item. To be<br/>sure, it will be generations before 1960 Edsels are as scarce as the Type 41 Bugatti, of which no<br/>more than eleven specimens were made, back in the late twenties, to be sold only to bona-fide kings,<br/>and the 1960 Edsel’s reasons for being a rarity are not exactly as acceptable, socially or<br/>commercially, as the Type 41 Bugatti’s. Still, a 1960-Edsel Owners’ Club may yet appear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The final fiscal box score on the Edsel fiasco will probably never be known, because the Ford<br/>Motor Company’s public reports do not include breakdowns of gains and losses within the individual<br/>divisions. Financial buffs estimate, however, that the company lost something like $200 million on the<br/>Edsel after it appeared; add to this the officially announced expenditure of $250 million before it</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>appeared, subtract about a hundred million invested in plant and equipment that were salvageable for<br/>other uses, and the net loss is $350 million. If these estimates are right, every Edsel the company<br/>manufactured cost it in lost money about $3,200, or about the price of another one. In other, harsher<br/>words, the company would have saved itself money if, back in 1955, it had decided not to produce<br/>the Edsel  at all  but simply to give away 110,810 specimens of its comparably priced car, the<br/>Mercury.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">THE </span>end of the Edsel set off an orgy of hindsight in the press. <i>Time </i><span>declared, “The Edsel was a<br/>classic case of the wrong car for the wrong market at the wrong time. It was also a prime example of<br/>the limitations of market research, with its ‘depth interviews’ and ‘motivational’ mumbo-jumbo.”<br/></span><i>Business Week </i><span>, which shortly before the Edsel made its bow had described it with patent solemnity<br/>and apparent approval, now pronounced it “a nightmare” and appended a few pointedly critical<br/>remarks about Wallace’s research, which was rapidly achieving a scapegoat status equal to that of<br/>Brown’s design. (Jumping up and down on motivational research was, and is, splendid sport, but, of<br/>course, the implication that it dictated, or even influenced, the Edsel’s design is entirely false, since<br/>the research, being intended only to provide a theme for advertising and promotion, was not<br/>undertaken until after Brown had completed his design.) The </span><i>Wall Street Journal’s </i><span>obituary of the<br/>Edsel made a point that was probably sounder, and certainly more original.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>Large corporations are often accused of rigging markets, administering prices, and otherwise dictating to the consumer [it observed].<br/>And yesterday Ford Motor Company announced its two-year experiment with the medium-priced Edsel has come to an end … for want<br/>of buyers. All this is quite a ways from auto makers being able to rig markets or force consumers to take what they want them to take.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>… And the reason, simply, is that there is no accounting for tastes.… When it comes to dictating, the consumer is the dictator without<br/>peer.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark68"><span>The tone of the piece was friendly and sympathetic; the Ford Company, it seemed, had endeared itself<br/>to the </span></a><i>Journal </i>by playing the great American situation-comedy role of Daddy the Bungler.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>As for the post-mortem explanations of the debacle that have been offered by former Edsel<br/>executives, they are notable for their reflective tone—something like that of a knocked-out prize<br/>fighter opening his eyes to find an announcer’s microphone pushed into his face. In fact, Krafve, like<br/>many a flattened pugilist, blames his own bad timing; he contends that if he had been able to thwart<br/>the apparently immutable mechanics and economics of Detroit, and had somehow been able to bring<br/>out the Edsel in 1955, or even 1956, when the stock market and the medium-priced-car market were<br/>riding high, the car would have done well and would still be doing well. That is to say, if he had seen<br/>the punch coming, he would have ducked. Krafve refuses to go along with a sizable group of laymen<br/>who tend to attribute the collapse to the company’s decision to call the car the Edsel instead of giving<br/>it a brisker, more singable name, reducible to a nickname other than “Ed” or “Eddie,” and not<br/>freighted with dynastic connotations. As far as he can see, Krafve still says, the Edsel’s name did not<br/>affect its fortunes one way or the other.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark69"><span>Brown agrees with Krafve that bad timing was the chief mistake. “I frankly feel that the styling of<br/>the automobile had very little, if anything, to do with its failure,” he said later, and his frankness may<br/>pretty safely be left unchallenged. “The Edsel program, like any other project planned for future<br/>markets, was based on the best information available at the time in which decisions were made. The<br/>road to Hell is paved with good intentions!”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Doyle, with the born salesman’s intensely personal feeling about his customers, talks like a man<br/>betrayed by a friend—the American public. “It was a buyers’ strike,” he says. “People weren’t in the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>mood for the Edsel. Why not is a mystery to me. What they’d been buying for several years<br/>encouraged the industry to build exactly this kind of car. We gave it to them, and they wouldn’t take it.<br/>Well, they shouldn’t have acted like that. You can’t just wake up somebody one day and say, ‘That’s<br/>enough, you’ve been running in the wrong direction.’ Anyway, </span><i>why </i><span>did they do it? Golly, how the<br/>industry worked and worked over the years—getting rid of gear-shifting, providing interior comfort,<br/>providing plus performance for use in emergencies! And now the public wants these little beetles. I<br/>don’t get it!”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Wallace’s sputnik theory provides an answer to Doyle’s question about why people weren’t in the<br/>mood, and, furthermore, it is sufficiently cosmic to befit a semi-Brain Truster. It also leaves Wallace<br/>free  to defend the validity of his motivational-research studies as of the time  when they were<br/>conducted. “I don’t think we yet know the depths of the psychological effect that that first orbiting had<br/>on us all,” he says. “Somebody had beaten us to an important gain in technology, and immediately<br/>people started writing articles about how crummy Detroit products were, particularly the heavily<br/>ornamented and status-symbolic medium-priced cars. In 1958, when none of the small cars were out<br/>except the Rambler, Chevy almost ran away with the market, because it had the simplest car. The<br/>American people had put themselves on a self-imposed austerity program. Not buying Edsels was<br/>their hair shirt.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TO <span class="p">any relics of the sink-or-swim nineteenth-century days of American industry, it must seem strange<br/>that Wallace can afford to puff on his pipe and analyze the holocaust so amiably. The obvious point of<br/>the Edsel’s story is the defeat of a giant motor company, but what is just as surprising is that the giant<br/>did not come apart, or even get seriously hurt in the fall, and neither did the majority of the people<br/>who went down with him. Owing largely to the success of four of its other cars—the Ford, the<br/>Thunderbird, and, later on the small Falcon and Comet and then the Mustang—the Ford Company, as<br/>an investment, survived gloriously. True, it had a bad time of it in 1958, when, partly because of the<br/>Edsel, net income per share of its stock fell from $5.40 to $2.12, dividends per share from $2.40 to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark70"><span>$2.00, and the market price of its stock from a 1957 high of about $60 to a 1958 low of under $40.<br/>But all these losses were more than recouped in 1959, when net income per share was $8.24,<br/>dividends per share were $2.80, and the price of the stock reached a high of around $90. In 1960 and<br/>1961, things went even better. So the 280,000 Ford stockholders listed on the books in 1957 had had<br/>little to complain about unless they had sold at the height of the panic. On the other hand, six thousand<br/>white-collar workers were squeezed out of their jobs as a result of the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln<br/>consolidation, and the average number of Ford employees fell from 191,759 in 1957 to 142,076 the<br/>following year, climbing back to only 159,541 in 1959. And, of course, dealers who gave up<br/>profitable franchises in other makes and then went broke trying to sell Edsels weren’t likely to be<br/>very cheerful about the experience. Under the terms of the consolidation of the Lincoln-Mercury and<br/>Edsel Divisions, most of the agencies for the three makes were consolidated, too. In the<br/>consolidation, some Edsel dealers were squeezed out, and it can have been small comfort to those of<br/>them who went bankrupt to learn later that when the Ford Company finally discontinued making the<br/>car, it agreed to pay those of their former colleagues who had weathered the crisis one-half of the<br/>original cost of their Edsel signs, and was granting them substantial rebates on all Edsels in stock at<br/>the time of discontinuance. Still, automobile dealers, some of whom work on credit margins as slim<br/>as those of Miami hotel operators, occasionally go broke with even the most popular cars. And<br/>among those who earn their living in the rough-and-tumble world of automobile salesrooms, where<br/>Detroit is not always spoken of with affection, many will concede that the Ford Company, once it had</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>found itself stuck with a lemon, did as much as it reasonably could to bolster dealers who had cast<br/>their lot with Edsel. A spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association has since stated,<br/>“So far as we know, the Edsel dealers were generally satisfied with the way they were treated.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark71"><span>Foote, Cone &amp; Belding also ended up losing money on the Edsel account, since its advertising<br/>commissions did not entirely compensate for the extraordinary expense it had gone to of hiring sixty<br/>new people and opening up a posh office in Detroit. But its losses were hardly irreparable; the minute<br/>there were no more Edsels to advertise, it was hired to advertise Lincolns, and although that<br/>arrangement did not last very long, the firm has happily survived to sing the praises of such clients as<br/>General Foods, Lever Brothers, and Trans World Airways. A rather touching symbol of the loyalty<br/>that the agency’s employees have for its former client is the fact that for several years after 1959, on<br/>every workday its private parking lot in Chicago was still dotted with Edsels. These faithful drivers,<br/>incidentally, are not unique. If Edsel owners have not found the means to a dream fulfillment, and if<br/>some      of them for a while had to put up with harrowing mechanical disorders, many of them more than<br/>a decade later cherish their cars as if they were Confederate bills, and on Used Car Row the Edsel is<br/>a high-premium item, with few cars being offered.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>By and large, the former Edsel executives did not just land on their feet, they landed in clover.<br/>Certainly no one can accuse the Ford Company of giving vent to its chagrin in the old-fashioned way,<br/>by vulgarly causing heads to roll. Krafve was assigned to assist Robert S. McNamara, at that time a<br/>Ford divisional vice-president (and later, of course, Secretary of Defense), for a couple of months,<br/>and then he moved to a staff job in company headquarters, stayed there for about a year, and left to<br/>become a vice-president of the Raytheon Company, of Waltham, Massachusetts, a leading electronics<br/>firm. In April, 1960, he was made its president. In the middle sixties he left to become a high-priced<br/>management consultant on the West Coast. Doyle, too, was offered a staff job with Ford, but after<br/>taking a trip abroad to think it over he decided to retire. “It was a question of my relationship to my<br/>dealers,” he explains. “I had assured them that the company was fully behind the Edsel for keeps, and<br/>I didn’t feel that I was the fellow to tell them now that it wasn’t.” After his retirement, Doyle<br/>remained about as busy as ever, keeping an eye on various businesses in which he has set up various<br/>friends and relatives, and conducting a consulting business of his own in Detroit. About a month<br/>before Edsel’s consolidation with Mercury and Lincoln, Warnock, the publicity man, left the division<br/>to become director of news services for the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp., in New York</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark72"><span>—a position he left in June, 1960, to become vice-president of Communications Counselors, the<br/>public-relations arm of McCann-Erickson. From there he went back to Ford, as Eastern promotion<br/>chief for Lincoln-Mercury—a case of a head that had not rolled but had instead been anointed.<br/>Brown, the embattled stylist, stayed on in Detroit for a while as chief stylist of Ford commercial<br/>vehicles and then went with the Ford Motor Company, Ltd., of England, where, again as chief stylist,<br/>he was assigned to direct the design of Consuls, Anglias, trucks, and tractors. He insisted that this<br/>post didn’t represent the Ford version of Siberia. “I have found it to be a most satisfying experience,<br/>and one of the best steps I have ever taken in my … career,” he stated firmly in a letter from England.<br/>“We are building a styling office and a styling team second to none in Europe.” Wallace, the semi-<br/>Brain Truster, was asked to continue semi-Brain Trusting for Ford, and, since he still didn’t like<br/>living in Detroit, or near it, was permitted to move to New York and to spend only two days a week<br/>at headquarters. (“They didn’t seem to care any more where I operated from,” he says modestly.) At<br/>the end of 1958, he left Ford, and he has since finally achieved his heart’s desire—to become a full-<br/>time scholar and teacher. He set about getting a doctorate in sociology at Columbia, writing his thesis<br/>on social change in Westport, Connecticut, which he investigated by busily quizzing its inhabitants;</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>meanwhile, he taught a course on “The Dynamics of Social Behavior” at the New School for Social<br/>Research, in Greenwich Village. “I’m through with industry,” he was heard to declare one day, with<br/>evident satisfaction, as he boarded a train for Westport, a bundle of questionnaires under his arm.<br/>Early in 1962, he became Dr. Wallace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark73"><span>The subsequent euphoria of these former Edsel men did not stem entirely from the fact of their<br/>economic survival; they appear to have been enriched spiritually. They are inclined to speak of their<br/>Edsel experience—except for those still with Ford, who are inclined to speak of it as little as<br/>possible—with the verve and garrulity of old comrades-in-arms hashing over their most thrilling<br/>campaign. Doyle is perhaps the most passionate reminiscer in the group. “It was more fun than I’ve<br/>ever had before or since,” he told a caller in 1960. “I suppose that’s because I worked the hardest<br/>ever. We all did. It was a good crew. The people who came with Edsel knew they were taking a<br/>chance, and I like people who’ll take chances. Yes, it was a wonderful experience, in spite of the<br/>unfortunate thing that happened. And we were on the right track, too! When I went to Europe just<br/>before retiring, I saw how it is there—nothing but compact cars, yet they’ve still got traffic jams over<br/>there, they’ve still got parking problems, they’ve still got accidents. Just try getting in and out of those<br/>low taxicabs without hitting your head, or try not to get clipped while you’re walking around the Arc<br/>de Triomphe. This small-car thing won’t last forever. I can’t see American drivers being satisfied for<br/>long with manual gear-shifting and limited performance. The pendulum will swing back.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Warnock, like many a public-relations man before him, claims that his job gave him an ulcer—his<br/>second.  “But I got over it,” he says. “That great Edsel team—I’d just like to see what it could have<br/>done if it had had the right product at the right time. It could have made millions, that’s what! The<br/>whole thing was two years out of my life that I’ll never forget. It was history in the making. Doesn’t it<br/>all tell you something about America in the fifties—high hopes, and less than complete fulfillment of<br/>them?”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Krafve, the boss of the great team <i>manqué</i><span>, is entirely prepared to testify that there is more to his<br/>former subordinates’ talk than just the romantic vaporings of old soldiers. “It was a wonderful group<br/>to work with,” he said not long ago. “They really put their hearts and guts into the job. I’m interested<br/>in a crew that’s strongly motivated, and that one was. When things went bad, the Edsel boys could<br/>have cried about how they’d given up wonderful opportunities to come with us, but if anybody did, I<br/>never heard about it. I’m not surprised that they’ve mostly come out all right. In industry, you take a<br/>bump now and then, but you bounce back as long as you don’t get defeated inside. I like to get<br/>together with somebody once in a while—Gayle Warnock or one of the others—and go over the<br/>humorous incidents, the tragic incidents.…”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Whether the nostalgia of the Edsel boys for the Edsel runs to the humorous or to the tragic, it is a<br/>thought-provoking phenomenon. Maybe it means merely that they miss the limelight they first basked<br/>in and later squirmed in, or maybe it means that a time has come when—as in Elizabethan drama but<br/>seldom before in American business—failure can have a certain grandeur that success never knows.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark74"><span>The word “styling” is a weed deeply embedded in the garden of automobilia.

Men of inherited<br/>wealth, some of them given to the denunciation of government in all its forms and manifestations, have<br/>shown themselves to be passionately interested in the financing of state and municipal governments,<br/>and have contributed huge sums to this end. Weddings between persons with very high incomes and<br/>persons with not so high incomes have tended to take place most often near the end of December and<br/>least often during January. Some exceptionally successful people, especially in the arts, have been<br/>abruptly and urgently instructed by their financial advisers to do no more gainful work under any<br/>circumstances for the rest of the current calendar year, and have followed this advice, even though it<br/>sometimes came as early as May or June. Actors and other people with high incomes from personal<br/>services have again and again become the proprietors of sand-and-gravel businesses, bowling alleys,<br/>and telephone-answering services, doubtless adding a certain </span><i>élan </i><span>to the conduct of those humdrum<br/>establishments. Motion-picture people, as if fulfilling a clockwork schedule of renunciation and<br/>reconciliation, have repeatedly abjured their native soil in favor of foreign countries for periods of<br/>eighteen months—only to embrace it again in the nineteenth. Petroleum investors have peppered the<br/>earth of Texas with speculative oil wells, taking risks far beyond what would be dictated by normal<br/>business judgment. Businessmen travelling on planes, riding in taxis, or dining in restaurants have<br/>again and again  been seen compulsively making entries in little notebooks that, if they were<br/>questioned, they would describe as “diaries;” however, far from being spiritual descendants of<br/>Samuel Pepys or Philip Hone, they were writing down only what everything cost. And owners and<br/>part owners of businesses have arranged to share their ownership with minor children, no matter how<br/>young; indeed, in at least one case of partnership agreement has been delayed pending the birth of one<br/>partner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark81"><span>As hardly anyone needs to be told, all these odd actions are directly traceable to various<br/>provisions of the federal income-tax law. Since they deal with birth, marriage, work, and styles and<br/>places of living, they give some idea of the scope of the law’s social effects, but since they are<br/>confined to the affairs of the well-to-do, they give no idea of the breadth of its economic impact.<br/>Inasmuch as almost sixty-three million individual returns were filed in a typical recent year—1964—<br/>it is not surprising that the income-tax law is often spoken of as the law of the land that most directly<br/>affects the most individuals, and inasmuch as income-tax collections account for almost three-quarters</span></a><a name="bookmark82">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>of our government’s gross receipts, it is understandable that it is considered our most important single<br/>fiscal measure. (Out of a gross from all sources of a hundred and twelve billion dollars for the fiscal<br/>year that ended June 30th, 1964, roughly fifty-four and a half billion came from individual income<br/>taxes and twenty-three and a third billion from corporation income taxes.) “In the popular mind, it is<br/>THE TAX,” the economics professors William J. Shultz and C. Lowell Harriss declare in their book<br/>“American Public Finance,” and the writer David T. Bazelon has suggested that the economic effect<br/>of the tax has been so sweeping as to create two quite separate kinds of United States currency—<br/>before-tax money and after-tax money. At any rate, no corporation is ever formed, nor are any<br/>corporation’s affairs conducted for as much as a single day, without the lavishing of earnest<br/>consideration upon the income tax, and hardly anyone in any income group can get by without thinking<br/>of it occasionally, while some people, of course, have had their fortunes or their reputations, or both,<br/>ruined as a result of their failure to comply with it. As far afield as Venice, an American visitor a few<br/>years ago was jolted to find on a brass plaque affixed to a coin box for contributions to the<br/>maintenance fund of the Basilica of San Marco the words “Deductible for U.S. Income-Tax<br/>Purposes.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark83"><span>A good deal of the attention given to the income tax is based on the proposition that the tax is<br/>neither logical nor equitable. Probably the broadest and most serious charge is that the law has close<br/>to its heart something very much like a lie; that is, it provides for taxing incomes at steeply<br/>progressive rates, and then goes on to supply an array of escape hatches so convenient that hardly<br/>anyone, no matter how rich, need pay the top rates or anything like them. For 1960, taxpayers with<br/>reportable incomes of between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand dollars paid, on the<br/>average, about 44 per cent, and even those few who reported incomes of over a million dollars paid<br/>well under 50 per cent—which happened to be just about the percentage that a single taxpayer was<br/>supposed to pay, and often did pay, if his income was forty-two thousand dollars. Another frequently<br/>heard charge is that the income tax is a serpent in the American Garden of Eden, offering such<br/>tempting opportunities for petty evasion that it induces a national fall from grace every April. Still<br/>another school  of critics contends that because of its labyrinthine quality (the basic statute, the<br/>Internal Revenue Code of 1954, runs to more than a thousand pages, and the court rulings and Internal<br/>Revenue Service regulations that elaborate it come to seventeen thousand) the income tax not only<br/>results in such idiocies as gravel-producing actors and unborn partners but is in fact that anomaly, a<br/>law that a citizen may be unable to comply with by himself. This situation, the critics declare, leads to<br/>an undemocratic state of affairs, for only the rich can afford the expensive professional advice<br/>necessary to minimize their taxes legally.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The income-tax law <i>in toto </i><span>has virtually no defenders, even though most fair-minded students of<br/>the subject agree that its effect over the half century that it has been in force has been to bring about a<br/>huge and healthy redistribution of wealth. When it comes to the income tax, we almost all want<br/>reform. As reformers, however, we are largely powerless, the chief reasons being the staggering<br/>complexity of the whole subject, which causes many people’s minds to go blank at the very mention<br/>of it, and the specific, knowledgeable, and energetic advocacy by small groups of the particular<br/>provisions they benefit from. Like any tax law, ours had a kind of immunity to reform; the very riches<br/>that people accumulate through the use of tax-avoidance devices can be—and constantly are—applied<br/>to fighting the elimination of those devices. Such influences, combined with the fierce demands made<br/>on the Treasury by defense spending and other rising costs of government (even leaving aside hot<br/>wars like the one in Vietnam), have brought about two tendencies so marked that they have assumed<br/>the shape of a natural political law: In the United States it is comparatively easy to raise tax rates and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark84"><span>to introduce tax-avoidance devices, and it is comparatively hard to lower tax rates and to eliminate<br/>tax-avoidance devices. Or so it seemed until 1964, when half of this natural law was spectacularly<br/>challenged by legislation, originally proposed by President Kennedy and pushed forward by<br/>President Johnson, that reduced the basic rates on individuals in two stages from a bottom of 20 per<br/>cent to a bottom of 14 per cent and from a top of 91 per cent to a top of 70 per cent, and reduced the<br/>top tax on corporations from 52 per cent to 48 per cent—all in all, by far the largest tax cut in our<br/>history. Meanwhile, however, the other half of the natural law remains immaculate. To be sure, the<br/>proposed tax changes advanced by President Kennedy included a program of substantial reforms to<br/>eliminate tax-avoidance devices, but so great was the outcry against the reforms that Kennedy himself<br/>soon abandoned most of them, and virtually none of them were enacted; on the contrary, the new law<br/>actually extended or enlarged one or two of the devices.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“Let’s face it, Clitus, we live in a tax era. Everything’s taxes,” one lawyer says to another in Louis<br/>Auchincloss’s book of short stories called “Powers of Attorney,” and the second lawyer, a<br/>traditionalist, can enter only a token demurrer. Considering the omnipresence of the income tax in<br/>American life, however, it is odd how rarely one encounters references to it in American fiction. This<br/>omission probably reflects the subject’s lack of literary elegance, but it may also reflect a national<br/>uneasiness about the income tax—a sense that we have willed into existence, and cannot will out of<br/>existence, a presence not wholly good or wholly bad but, rather, so immense, outrageous, and morally<br/>ambiguous that it cannot be encompassed by the imagination. How in the world, one may ask, did it<br/>all happen?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark85"><span class="s6">AN </span></a><span>income tax can be truly effective only in an industrial country where there are many wage and<br/>salary earners, and the annals of income taxation up to the present century are comparatively short and<br/>simple. The universal taxes of ancient times, like the one that brought Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem<br/>just before the birth of Jesus, were invariably head taxes, with one fixed sum to be paid by<br/>everybody, rather than income taxes. Before about 1800, only two important attempts were made to<br/>establish income taxes—one in Florence during the fifteenth century, and the other in France during<br/>the eighteenth. Generally speaking, both represented efforts by grasping rulers to mulct their subjects.<br/>According to the foremost historian of the income tax, the late Edwin R. A. Seligman, the Florentine<br/>effort withered away as a result of corrupt and inefficient administration. The eighteenth-century<br/>French tax, in the words of the same authority, “soon became honeycombed with abuses” and<br/>degenerated into “a completely unequal and thoroughly arbitrary imposition upon the less well-to-do<br/>classes,” and, as such, it undoubtedly played its part in whipping up the murderous fervor that went<br/>into the French Revolution. The rate of the </span><i>ancien-régime </i><span>tax, which was enacted by Louis XIV in<br/>1710, was 10 per cent, a figure that was cut in half later, but not in time; the revolutionary regime<br/>eliminated the tax along with its perpetrators. In the face of this cautionary example, Britain enacted<br/>an income tax in 1798 to help finance her participation in the French revolutionary wars, and this<br/>was, in several respects, the first modern income tax; for one thing, it had graduated rates,<br/>progressing from zero, on annual incomes under sixty pounds, to 10 per cent, on incomes of two<br/>hundred pounds or more, and, for another, it was complicated, containing a hundred and twenty-four<br/>sections, which took up a hundred and fifty-two pages. Its unpopularity was general and<br/>instantaneous, and a spate of pamphlets denouncing it soon appeared; one pamphleteer, who<br/>purported to be looking back at ancient barbarities from the year 2000, spoke of the income-tax<br/>collectors of old as “merciless mercenaries” and “brutes … with all the rudeness that insolence and<br/>self-important ignorance could suggest.” After yielding only about six million pounds a year for three</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>years—in large part because of widespread evasion—it was repealed in 1802, after the Treaty of<br/>Amiens, but the following year, when the British treasury again found itself in straitened<br/>circumstances, Parliament enacted a new income-tax law. This one was extraordinarily far ahead of<br/>its time, in that it included a provision for the withholding of income at the source, and, perhaps for<br/>that reason, it was hated even more than the earlier tax had been, even though its top rate was only<br/>half as high. At a protest meeting held in the City of London in July, 1803, several speakers made<br/>what, for Britons, must surely have been the ultimate commitment of enmity toward the income tax. If<br/>such a measure were necessary to save the country, they said, then they would reluctantly have to<br/>choose to let the country go.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Yet gradually, despite repeated setbacks, and even extended periods of total oblivion, the British<br/>income tax began to flourish. This may have been, as much as anything else, a matter of simple<br/>habituation, for a common thread runs through the history of income taxes everywhere: Opposition is<br/>always at its most reckless and strident at the very outset; with every year that passes, the tax tends to<br/>become stronger and the voices of its enemies more muted. Britain’s income tax was repealed the<br/>year after the victory at Waterloo, was revived in a halfhearted way in 1832, was sponsored with<br/>enthusiasm by Sir Robert Peel a decade later, and remained in effect thereafter. The basic rate during<br/>the second half of the nineteenth century varied between 5 per cent and less than 1 per cent, and it was<br/>only 2½ per cent, with a modest surtax on high incomes, as late as 1913. The American idea of very<br/>high rates on high incomes eventually caught on in Britain, though, and by the middle 1960’s the top<br/>British bracket was over 90 per cent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Elsewhere in the world—or at least in the economically developed world—country after country<br/>took  the cue from Britain and instituted an income tax at one time or another during the nineteenth<br/>century. Post-revolutionary France soon enacted an income tax, but then repealed it and managed to<br/>get along without one for a number of years in the second half of the century; eventually, though, the<br/>loss of revenue proved to be intolerable, and the tax returned, to become a fixture of the French<br/>economy. An income tax was one of the first, if not one of the sweetest, fruits of Italian unity, while<br/>several of the separate states that were to combine into the German nation had income taxes even<br/>before they were united. By 1911, income taxes also existed in Austria, Spain, Belgium, Sweden,<br/>Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Holland, Greece, Luxembourg, Finland, Australia, New Zealand,<br/>Japan, and India.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark86"><span>As for the United States, the enormous size of whose income-tax collections and the apparent<br/>docility of whose taxpayers are now the envy of governments everywhere, it was a laggard in the<br/>matter of instituting an income tax and for years was an inveterate backslider in the matter of keeping<br/>one on its statute books. It is true that in Colonial times there were various revenue systems bearing<br/>some slight resemblance to income taxes—in Rhode Island at one point, for example, each citizen<br/>was supposed to guess the financial status of ten of his neighbors, in regard to both income and<br/>property, in order to provide a basis for tax assessments—but such schemes, being inefficient and<br/>subject to obvious opportunities for abuse, were short-lived. The first man to propose a federal<br/>income tax was President Madison’s Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander J. Dallas; he did so in<br/>1814, but a few months later the War of 1812 ended, the demand for government revenue eased, and<br/>the Secretary was hooted down so decisively that the subject was not revived until the time of the<br/>Civil War, when both the Union and the Confederacy enacted income-tax bills. Before 1900, very<br/>few new income taxes appear to have been enacted anywhere without the stimulus of a war. National<br/>income taxes were—and until quite recently largely remained—war and defense measures. In June of<br/>1862, prodded by public concern over a public debt that was increasing at the rate of two million</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>dollars a day, Congress reluctantly passed a law providing for an income tax at progressive rates up<br/>to a maximum of 10 per cent, and on July 1st President Lincoln signed it into law, along with a bill to<br/>punish the practice of polygamy. (The next day, stocks on the New York Exchange took a dive, which<br/>was probably not attributable to the polygamy bill.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark87"><span>“I am taxed on my income! This is perfectly gorgeous! I never felt so important in my life before,”<br/>Mark  Twain wrote in the Virginia City, Nevada, </span></a><i>Territorial Enterprise </i><span>after he had paid his first<br/>income-tax bill, for the year 1864—$36.82, including a penalty of $3.12 for being late. Although few<br/>other taxpayers were so enthusiastic, the law remained in force until 1872. It was, however,<br/>subjected to a succession of rate reductions and amendments, one of them being the elimination, in<br/>1865, of its progressive rates, on the arresting ground that collecting 10 per cent on high incomes and<br/>lower rates on lower incomes constituted undue discrimination against wealth. Annual revenue<br/>collections mounted from two million dollars in 1863 to seventy-three million in 1866, and then<br/>descended sharply. For two decades, beginning in the early eighteen-seventies, the very thought of an<br/>income tax did not enter the American mind, apart from rare occasions when some Populist or<br/>Socialist agitator would propose the establishment of such a tax designed specifically to soak the<br/>urban rich. Then, in 1893, when it had become clear that the country was relying on an obsolete<br/>revenue system that put too little burden on businessmen and members of the professions, President<br/>Cleveland proposed an income tax. The outcry that followed was shrill. Senator John Sherman, of<br/>Ohio, the father of the Sherman Antitrust Act, called the proposal “socialism, communism, and<br/>devilism,” and another senator spoke darkly of “the professors with their books, the socialists with<br/>their schemes … [and] the anarchists with their bombs,” while over in the House a congressman from<br/>Pennsylvanialaid his cards on the table in the following terms:</span><a name="bookmark88">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>An income tax!

It is class legislation.… Do you desire to offer a reward to dishonesty<br/>and to encourage perjury? The imposition of the tax will corrupt the people. It will bring in its train the spy and the informer. It will<br/>necessitate a swarm of officials with inquisitorial powers.… Mr. Chairman, pass this bill and the Democratic Party signs its death<br/>warrant.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark89"><span>The proposal that gave rise to these fulminations was for a tax at a uniform rate of 2 per cent on<br/>income in excess of four thousand dollars, and it was enacted into law in 1894. The Democratic Party<br/>survived, but the new law did not. Before it could be put into force, it was thrown out by the Supreme<br/>Court, on the ground that it violated the Constitutional provision forbidding “direct” taxes unless they<br/>were apportioned among the states according to population (curiously, this point had not been raised<br/>in connection with the Civil War income tax), and the income-tax issue was dead again, this time for<br/>a decade and a half. In 1909, by what a tax authority named Jerome Hellerstein has called “one of the<br/>most ironic twists of political events in American history,” the Constitutional amendment (the<br/>sixteenth) that eventually gave Congress the power to levy taxes without apportionment among the<br/>states was put forward by the implacable opponents of the income tax, the Republicans, who took the<br/>step as a political move, confidently believing that the amendment would never be ratified by the<br/>states. To their dismay, it was ratified in 1913, and later that year Congress enacted a graduated tax<br/>on individuals at rates ranging from 1 per cent to 7 per cent, and also a flat tax of 1 per cent on the net<br/>profits of corporations. The income tax has been with us ever since.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>By and large, its history since 1913 has been one of rising rates and of the seasonable appearance<br/>of special provisions to save people in the upper brackets from the inconvenience of having to pay<br/>those rates. The first sharp rise took place during the First World War, and by 1918 the bottom rate</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark90"><span>was 6 per cent and the top one, applicable to taxable income in excess of a million dollars, was 77<br/>per cent, or far more than any government had previously ventured to exact on income of any amount.<br/>But the end of the war and the “return to normalcy” brought a reversal of the trend, and there followed<br/>an era of low taxes for rich and poor alike. Rates were reduced by degrees until 1925, when the<br/>standard rate scale ran from 1½ per cent to an absolute top of 25 per cent, and, furthermore, a great<br/>majority of the country’s wage earners were relieved of paying any tax at all by being allowed<br/>personal exemptions of fifteen hundred dollars for a single person, thirty-five hundred dollars for a<br/>married couple, and four hundred dollars for each dependent. This was not the whole story, for it was<br/>during the twenties that special-interest provisions began to appear, stimulated into being by the<br/>complex of political forces that has accounted for their increase at intervals ever since. The first<br/>important one, adopted in 1922, established the principle of favored treatment for capital gains; this<br/>meant that money acquired through a rise in the value of investments was, for the first time, taxed at a<br/>lower rate than money earned in wages or for services—as, of course, it still is today. Then, in 1926,<br/>came the loophole that has undoubtedly caused more gnashing of teeth among those not in a position to<br/>profit by it than any other—the percentage depletion allowance on petroleum, which permits the<br/>owner of a producing oil well to deduct from his taxable income up to 27½ per cent of his gross<br/>annual income from the well and to keep deducting that much year after year, even though he has<br/>deducted the original cost of the well many times over. Whether or not the twenties were a golden age<br/>for the American people in general, they were assuredly a golden age for the American taxpayer.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The depression and the New Deal brought with them a trend toward higher tax rates and lower<br/>exemptions, which led up to a truly revolutionary era in federal income taxation—that of the Second<br/>World War. By 1936, largely because of greatly increased public spending, rates in the higher<br/>brackets were roughly double what they had been in the late twenties, and the very top bracket was 79<br/>per cent, while, at the low end of the scale, personal exemptions had been reduced to the point where<br/>a single person was required to pay a small tax even if his income was only twelve hundred dollars.<br/>(As a matter of fact, at that time most industrial workers’ incomes did not exceed twelve hundred<br/>dollars.) In 1944 and 1945, the rate scale for individuals reached its historic peak—23 per cent at the<br/>low end and 94 per cent at the high one—while income taxes on corporations, which had been<br/>creeping up gradually from the original 1913 rate of 1 per cent, reached the point where some<br/>companies were liable for 80 per cent. But the revolutionary thing about wartime taxation was not the<br/>very high rates on high incomes; indeed, in 1942, when this upward surge was approaching full flood,<br/>a new means of escape for high-bracket taxpayers appeared, or an old one widened, for the period<br/>during which stocks or other assets must be held in order to benefit from the capital-gains provision<br/>was reduced from eighteen months to six. What was revolutionary was the rise of industrial wages<br/>and the extension of substantial tax rates to the wage earner, making him, for the first time, an<br/>important contributor to government revenue. Abruptly, the income tax became a mass tax.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark91"><span>And so it has remained. Although taxes on big and middle-sized businesses settled down to a flat<br/>rate of 52 per cent, rates on individual income did not change significantly between 1945 and 1964.<br/>(That is to say, the basic rates did not change significantly; there were temporary remissions,<br/>amounting to anywhere from 5 per cent to 17 per cent of the sums due under the basic rates, during the<br/>years 1946 through 1950.) The range was from 20 per cent to 91 per cent until 1950; there was a<br/>small rise during the Korean War, but it went right back there in 1954. In 1950, another important<br/>escape route, the so-called “restricted stock option,” opened up, enabling some corporate executives<br/>to be taxed on part of their compensation at low capital-gains rates. The significant change, invisible<br/>in the rate schedule, has been a continuation of the one begun in wartime; namely, the increase in the</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>proportionate tax burden carried by the middle and lower income groups. Paradoxical as it may seem,<br/>the evolution of our income tax has been from a low-rate tax relying for revenue on the high income<br/>group to a high-rate tax relying on the middle and lower-middle income groups. The Civil War levy,<br/>which affected only one per cent of the population, was unmistakably a rich man’s tax, and the same<br/>was true of the 1913 levy. Even in 1918, at the height of the budget squeeze produced by the First<br/>World War, less than four and a half million Americans, of a total population of more than a hundred<br/>million, had to file income-tax returns at all. In 1933, in the depths of the depression, only three and<br/>three-quarters million returns were filed, and in 1939 an élite consisting of seven hundred thousand<br/>taxpayers, of a population of a hundred and thirty million, accounted for nine-tenths of all income-tax<br/>collections, while in 1960 it took some thirty-two million taxpayers—something over one-sixth of the<br/>population—to account for nine-tenths of all collections, and a whopping big nine-tenths it was,<br/>totalling some thirty-five and a half billion dollars, compared to less than a billion in 1939.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark92"><span>The historian Seligman wrote in 1911 that the history of income taxation the world over consisted<br/>essentiallyof “evolution toward basing it on ability to pay.” One wonders what qualifications he<br/>might add, on the basis of the American experience since then, if he were still alive. Of course, one<br/>reason people with middle incomes pay far more in taxes than they used to is that there are far more<br/>of them. Changes in the country’s social and economic structure have been as big a factor in the shift<br/>as the structure of the income tax has. It remains probable, though, that, in actual practice, the<br/>aboriginal income tax of 1913 extracted money from citizens with stricter regard to their ability to<br/>pay than the present income tax does.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">WHATEVER </span><span>the faults of our income-tax law, it is beyond question the best-obeyed income-tax law in<br/>the world, and income taxes are now ubiquitous, from the Orient to the Occident and from pole to<br/>pole. (Practically all of the dozens of new nations that have come into being over the past few years<br/>have adopted income-tax measures. Walter H. Diamond, the editor of a publication called </span><i>Foreign</i><span>, has noted that as recently as 1955 he could rattle off the names of two dozen<br/>countries, large and small, that did not tax the individual, but that in 1965 the only names he could<br/>rattle off were those of a couple of British colonies, Bermuda and the Bahamas; a couple of tiny<br/>republics, San Marino and Andorra; three oil-rich Middle Eastern countries, the Sultanate of Muscat<br/>and Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar; and two rather inhospitable countries, Monaco and Saudi Arabia,<br/>which taxed the incomes of resident foreigners but not those of nationals. Even Communist countries<br/>have income taxes, though they count on them for only a small percentage of their total revenue;<br/>Russia applies different rates to different occupations, shopkeepers and ecclesiastics being in the high<br/>tax bracket, artists and writers near the middle, and laborers and artisans at the bottom.) Evidence of<br/>the superior efficiency of tax collecting in the United States is plentiful; for instance, our costs for<br/>administration and enforcement come to only about forty-four cents for every hundred dollars<br/>collected, as against a rate more than twice as high in Canada, more than three times as high in<br/>England, France, and Belgium, and many times as high in other places. This kind of American<br/>efficiency is the despair of foreign tax collectors. Toward the end of his term in office Mortimer M.<br/>Caplin, who was commissioner of Internal Revenue from January, 1961, until July, 1964, held<br/>consultations with the leading tax administrators of six Western European countries, and the question<br/>heard again and again was “How do you do it? Do they </span><i>like </i><span>to pay taxes over there?” Of course, they<br/>do not, but, as Caplin said at the time, “we have a lot going for us that the Europeans haven’t.” One<br/>thing we have going for us is tradition. American income taxes originated and developed not as a<br/>result of the efforts of monarchs to fill their coffers at the expense of their subjects but as a result of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>the efforts of an elected government to serve the general interest. A widely travelled tax lawyer<br/>observed not long ago, “In most countries, it’s impossible to engage in a serious discussion of income<br/>taxes, because they aren’t taken seriously.” They are taken seriously here, and part of the reason is the<br/>power and skill of our income-tax police force, the Internal Revenue Service.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark93"><span>Unquestionably, the “swarm of officials” feared by the Pennsylvania congressman in 1894 has<br/>come into being—and there are  those who would add that the  officials have the “inquisitorial<br/>powers” he also feared. As of the beginning of 1965, the Internal Revenue Service had approximately<br/>sixty thousand employees, including more than six thousand revenue officers and more than twelve<br/>thousand revenue agents, and these eighteen thousand men, possessing the right to inquire into every<br/>penny of everyone’s income and into matters like exactly what was discussed at an expense-account<br/>meal, and armed with the threat of heavy punishments, have powers that might reasonably be called<br/>inquisitorial. But the I.R.S. engages in many activities besides actual tax collecting, and some of these<br/>suggest that it exercises its despotic powers in an equitable way, if not actually in a benevolent one.<br/>Notable among the additional activities is a taxpayer-education program on a scale that occasionally<br/>inspires an official to boast that the I.R.S. runs the largest university in the world. As part of this<br/>program, it puts out dozens of publications explicating various aspects of the law, and it is proud of<br/>the fact that the most general of these—a blue-covered pamphlet entitled “Your Federal Income Tax,”<br/>which is issued annually and in 1965 could be bought for forty cents at any District Director’s office</span></a><a name="bookmark94">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—is so popular that it is often reprinted by private publishers, who sell it to the unwary for a dollar<br/>or more, pointing out, with triumphant accuracy, that it is an official government publication. (Since<br/>government publications are not copyrighted, this is perfectly legal.) The I.R.S. also conducts<br/>“institutes” on technical questions every December for the enlightenment of the vast corps of “tax<br/>practitioners”—accountants and lawyers—who will shortly be preparing the returns of individuals<br/>and corporations. It puts out elementary tax manuals designed specially for free distribution to any<br/>high schools that ask for them—and, according to one I.R.S. official, some eighty-five per cent of<br/>American high schools did ask for them in one recent year. (The question of whether schoolchildren<br/>ought to be spending their time boning up on the tax laws is one that the I.R.S. considers to be outside<br/>its scope.) Furthermore,  just before the tax deadline each year, the I.R.S. customarily goes on<br/>television with spot advertisements offering tax pointers and reminders. It is proud to say that, of the<br/>various spots, a clear majority have been in the interests of protecting taxpayers from overpaying.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark95"><span>In the fall of 1963, the I.R.S. took a big step toward increasing the efficiency of its collections still<br/>further, and, by a feat worthy of the wolf in “Little Red Riding Hood,” it managed to present the step<br/>to the public as a grandmotherly move to help everybody out. The step was the establishment of a so-<br/>called national-identity file, involving the assignment to every taxpayer of an account number (usually<br/>his Social Security number), and its intention was to practically eliminate the problem created by<br/>people who fail to declare their income from corporate dividends or from interest on bank accounts<br/>or bonds—a form of evasion that was thought to have been costing the Treasury hundreds of millions<br/>a year. But that is not all. When the number is entered in the proper place on a return, “this will make<br/>certain that you are given immediate credit for taxes reported and paid by you, and that any refund<br/>will be promptly recorded in your favor”—so Commissioner Caplin commented brightly on the front<br/>cover of the 1964 tax-return forms. The I.R.S. then began taking another giant step—the adoption of a<br/>system for automating a large part of the tax-checking process, in which seven regional computers<br/>would collect and collate data that would be fed into a master data-processing center at Martinsburg,<br/>West Virginia. This installation, designed to make a quarter of a million number comparisons per<br/>second, began to be called the Martinsburg Monster even before it was in full operation. In 1965,</span></a><a name="bookmark96">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>between four and five million returns a year were given a complete audit, and all returns were<br/>checked for mathematical errors. Some of this mathematical work was being done by computers and<br/>some by people, but by 1967, when the computer system was going full blast, </span><i>all </i><span>the mathematical<br/>work was done by machine, thus freeing many I.R.S. employees to subject even more returns to<br/>detailed audits. According to a publication authorized by the I.R.S. back in 1963, though, “the<br/>capacity and memory of the [computer] system will help taxpayers who forget prior year credits or<br/>who do not take full advantage of their rights under the laws.” In short, it was going to be a </span><i>friendly</i>monster.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark97"><span class="s6">IF </span></a><span>the mask that the I.R.S. had presented to the country in recent years has worn a rather ghastly<br/>expression of benignity, part of the explanation is probably nothing more sinister than the fact that<br/>Caplin, the man who dominated it in those years, is a cheerful extrovert and a natural politician, and<br/>that his influence continued to be felt under the man who was appointed to succeed him as<br/>Commissioner in December 1964—a young Washington lawyer named Sheldon S. Cohen, who took<br/>over the job after a six-month interim during which an I.R.S. career man named Bertrand M. Harding<br/>served as Acting Commissioner. (When Caplin resigned as Commissioner, he stepped out of politics,<br/>at least temporarily, returning to his Washington law practice as a specialist in, among other things,<br/>the tax problems of businessmen.) Caplin is widely considered to have been one of the best<br/>Commissioners of Internal Revenue in history, and, at the very least, he was certainly an improvement<br/>on two fairly recent occupants of the post, one of whom, some time after leaving it, was convicted<br/>and sentenced to two years in prison for evading his own income taxes, and the other of whom<br/>subsequently ran for public office on a platform of opposition to any federal income tax—as a former<br/>umpire might stump the country against baseball. Among the accomplishments that Mortimer Caplin, a<br/>small, quick-spoken, dynamic man who grew up in New York City and used to be a University of<br/>Virginia law professor, is credited with as Commissioner is the abolition of the practice that had<br/>previously been alleged to exist of assigning collection quotas to I.R.S. agents. He gave the top<br/>echelons of I.R.S. an air of integrity beyond cavil, and, what was perhaps most striking, managed the<br/>strange feat of projecting to the nation a sort of enthusiasm for taxes, considered abstractly. Thus he<br/>managed to collect them with a certain style—a sort of subsidiary New Frontier, which he called the<br/>New Direction. The chief thrust of the New Direction was to put increased emphasis on education<br/>leading toward increased voluntary compliance with the tax law, instead of concentrating on the<br/>search for and prosecution of conscious offenders. In a manifesto that Caplin issued to his swarm of<br/>officials in the spring of 1961, he wrote, “We all should understand that the Service is not simply<br/>running a direct enforcement business aimed at making $2 billion in additional assessments,<br/>collecting another billion from delinquent accounts, and prosecuting a few hundred evaders. Rather, it<br/>is charged with administering an enormous self-assessment tax system which raises over $90 billion<br/>from what people themselves put down on their tax returns and voluntarily pay, with another $2 or $3<br/>billion coming from direct enforcement activities. In short, we cannot forget that 97 per cent of our<br/>total revenue comes from self-assessment or voluntary compliance, with only three per cent coming<br/>directly from enforcement. </span><i>Our chief mission is to encourage and achieve more effective voluntary</i>The New Direction is really a shift in emphasis. <i>But it is a very important shift</i><span>.” It<br/>may be, though, that the true spirit of the New Direction is better epitomized on the jacket of a book<br/>entitled “The American Way in Taxation,” edited by Lillian Doris, which was published in 1963 with<br/>the blessing of Caplin, who wrote the foreword. “Here is the exciting story of the largest and most<br/>efficient tax collecting organization the world has ever known—the United States Internal Revenue</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Service!” the jacket announced, in part. “Here are the stirring events, the bitterly-fought legislative<br/>battles, the dedicated civil servants that have marched through the past century and left an indelible<br/>imprint on our nation. You’ll thrill to the epic legal battle to kill the income tax … and you’ll be<br/>astonished at the future plans of the I.R.S. You’ll see how giant computers, now on the drawing<br/>boards, are going to affect the tax collection system and influence the lives of many American men<br/>and women in new and unusual ways!” It sounded a bit like a circus barker hawking a public<br/>execution.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It is debatable whether the New Direction watchword of “voluntary compliance” could properly<br/>be used to describe a system of tax collection under which some three-quarters of all collections from<br/>individuals are obtained through withholding at the source, under which the I.R.S. and its Martinsburg<br/>Monster lurk to catch the unwary evader, and under which the punishment for evasion runs up to five<br/>years in prison per offense in addition to extremely heavy financial penalties. Caplin, however, did<br/>not seem to feel a bit of concern over this point. With tireless good humor, he made the rounds of the<br/>nation’s organizations of businessmen, accountants, and lawyers, giving luncheon talks in which he<br/>praised them for their voluntary compliance in the past, exhorted them to greater efforts in the future,<br/>and assured them that it was all in a good cause. “We’re still striving for the human touch in our tax<br/>administration,” declared the essay on the cover of the 1964 tax-return forms, which Caplin signed,<br/>and which he says he composed in collaboration with his wife. “I see a lot of humor in this job,” he<br/>told a caller a few hours after remarking to a luncheon meeting of the Kiwanis Club of Washington at<br/>the Mayflower Hotel, “Last year was the fiftieth anniversary of the income-tax amendment to the<br/>Constitution, but the Internal Revenue Service somehow or other didn’t seem to get any birthday<br/>cakes.” This might perhaps be considered a form of gallows humor, except that the hangman is not<br/>supposed to be the one who makes the jokes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark98"><span>Cohen, the Commissioner who succeeded Caplin and was still in office in mid-1968, is a born-<br/>and-bred Washingtonian who, in 1952, graduated from George Washington University Law School at<br/>the top of his class; served in a junior capacity with the I.R.S. for the next four years; practiced law in<br/>Washington for seven years after that, eventually becoming a partner in the celebrated firm of Arnold,<br/>Fortas &amp; Porter; at the beginning of 1964 returned to the I.R.S., as its chief counsel; and a year later,<br/>at the age of thirty-seven, became the youngest Commissioner of Internal Revenue in history. A man<br/>with close-cropped brown hair, candid eyes, and a guileless manner that makes him seem even<br/>younger than he is, Cohen came from the chief counsel’s office with the reputation of having uplifted<br/>it both practically and philosophically; he was responsible for an administrative reorganization that<br/>has been widely praised as making faster decisions possible, and for a demand that the I.R.S. be<br/>consistent in its legal stand in cases against taxpayers (that it refrain from taking one position on a fine<br/>point of Code interpretation in Philadelphia, say, and the opposite position on the same point in<br/>Omaha), which is considered a triumph of high principle over governmental greed. In general, Cohen<br/>said upon assuming office, he intended to continue Caplin’s policies—to emphasize “voluntary<br/>compliance,” to strive for agreeable, or at least not </span></a><i>dis</i><span>agreeable, relations with the taxpaying public,<br/>and so on. He is a less gregarious and a more reflective  man than Caplin, however, and this<br/>difference has had its effect on the I.R.S. as a whole. He has stuck relatively close to his desk, leaving<br/>the luncheon-circuit pep talks to subordinates. “Mort was wonderful at that sort of thing,” Cohen said<br/>in 1965. “Public opinion of the Service is high now as a result of his big push in that direction. We<br/>want to keep it high without more pushing on my part. Anyhow, I couldn’t do it well—I’m not made<br/>that way.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A charge that has often been made, and continues to be made, is that the office of Commissioner</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark99"><span>carries with it far too much power. The Commissioner has no authority to propose changes in rates or<br/>initiate other new tax legislation—the authority to propose rate changes belongs to the Secretary of<br/>the Treasury, who may or may not seek the Commissioner’s advice in the matter, and the enactment of<br/>new tax laws is, of course, the job of Congress and the President—but tax laws, since they must cover<br/>so many different situations, are necessarily written in rather general terms, and the Commissioner is<br/>solely responsible (subject to reversal in the courts) for writing the regulations that are supposed to<br/>explain the laws in detail. And sometimes the regulations are a bit cloudy themselves, and in such<br/>cases who is better qualified to explain </span></a><i>them </i><span>than their author, the Commissioner? Thus it comes<br/>about that almost every word that drops from the Commissioner’s mouth, whether at his desk or at<br/>luncheon meetings, is immediately distributed by the various tax publishing services to tax<br/>accountants and lawyers all over the country and is gobbled up by them with an avidity not always<br/>accorded the remarks of an appointed official. Because of this, some people see the Commissioner as<br/>a virtual tyrant. Others, including both theoretical and practical tax experts, disagree. Jerome<br/>Hellerstein, who is a law professor at New York University Law School as well as a tax adviser,<br/>says, “The latitude of action given the Commissioner is great, and it’s true that he can do things that<br/>may affect the economic development of the country as well as the fortunes of individuals and<br/>corporations. But if he had small freedom of action, it would result in rigidity and certainty of<br/>interpretation, and would make it much easier for tax practitioners like me to manipulate the law to<br/>their clients’ advantage. The Commissioner’s latitude gives him a healthy unpredictability.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark100">CERTAINLY </a><span class="p">Caplin did not knowingly abuse his power, nor has Cohen done so. Upon visiting first one<br/>man and then the other in the Commissioner’s office, I found that both conveyed the impression of<br/>being men of high intelligence who were living—as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., has said that Thoreau<br/>lived—at a high degree of moral tension. And the cause of the moral tension is not hard to find; it<br/>almost surely stemmed from the difficulty of presiding over compliance, voluntary or involuntary,<br/>with a law of which one does not very heartily approve. In 1958, when Caplin appeared—as a<br/>witness versed in tax matters, rather than as Commissioner of Internal Revenue—before the House<br/>Ways and Means Committee, he proposed an across-the-board program of reforms, including, among<br/>other things, either the total elimination or a drastic curbing of favored treatment for capital gains; the<br/>lowering of percentage depletion rates on petroleum and other minerals; the withholding of taxes on<br/>dividends and interest; and the eventual drafting of an entirely new income-tax law to replace the<br/>1954 Code, which he declared had led to “hardships, complexities, and opportunities for tax<br/>avoidance.” Shortly after Caplin left office, he explained in detail what his ideal tax law would be<br/>like. Compared to the present tax law, it would be heroically simple, with loopholes eliminated, and<br/>most personal deductions and exemptions eliminated, too, and with a rate scale ranging from 10 to 50<br/>per cent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In Caplin’s case, the resolution of moral tension, insofar as he achieved it, was not entirely the<br/>result of rational analysis. “Some critics take a completely cynical view of the income tax,” he mused<br/>one day during his stint as Commissioner. “They say, in effect, ‘It’s a mess, and nothing can be done<br/>about it.’ I can’t go along with that. True, many compromises are necessary, and will continue to be.<br/>But I refuse to accept a defeatist attitude. There’s a mystic quality about our tax system. No matter<br/>how bad it may be from the technical standpoint, it has a vitality because of the very high level of<br/>compliance.” He paused for quite a long time, perhaps finding a flaw in his own argument; in the past,<br/>after all, universal compliance with a law has not always been a sign that it was either intelligent or<br/>just. Then he went on, “Looking over the sweep of years, I think we’ll come out well. Probably a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>point of crisis of some kind will make us begin to see beyond selfish interests. I’m optimistic that fifty<br/>years from now we’ll have a pretty good tax.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>As for Cohen, he was working in the legislation-drafting section of the I.R.S. at the time the present<br/>Code was written, and he had a hand in its composition. One might suppose that this fact would cause<br/>him to have a certain proprietary feeling toward it, but apparently that is not so. “Remember that we<br/>had a Republican administration then, and I’m a Democrat,” he said one day in 1965. “When you are<br/>drafting a statute, you operate as a technician. Any pride you may feel afterward is pride in technical<br/>competence.” So Cohen can reread his old prose, now enshrined as law, with neither elation nor<br/>remorse, and he has not the slightest hesitation about endorsing Caplin’s opinion that the Code leads<br/>to “hardships, complexities, and opportunities for tax avoidance.” He is more pessimistic than Caplin<br/>about finding the answer in simplification. “Perhaps we can move the rates down and get rid of some<br/>deductions,” he says, “but then we may find we need new deductions, in the interests of fairness. I<br/>suspect that a complex society requires a complex tax law. If we put in a simpler code, it would<br/>probably be complex again in a few years.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">II</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark101">“EVERY </a><span class="p">nation has the government it deserves,” the French writer and diplomat Joseph de Maistre<br/>declared in 1811. Since the primary function of government is to make laws, the statement implies<br/>that every nation has the laws it deserves, and if the doctrine may be considered at best a half truth in<br/>the case of governments that exist by force, it does seem persuasive in the case of governments that<br/>exist by popular consent. If the single most important law now on the statute books of the United<br/>States is the income-tax law, it would follow that we must have the income-tax law we deserve.<br/>Much of the voluminous discussion of the income-tax law in recent years has centered on plain<br/>violations of it, among them the deliberate padding of tax-deductible business-expense accounts, the<br/>matter of taxable income that is left undeclared on tax returns, fraudulently or otherwise—a sum<br/>estimated at as high as twenty-five billion dollars a year—and the matter of corruption within the<br/>ranks of the Internal Revenue Service, which some authorities believe to be fairly common, at least in<br/>large cities. Such forms of outlawry, of course, reflect timeless and worldwide human frailties. The<br/>law itself, however, has certain characteristics that are more closely related to a particular time and<br/>place, and if de Maistre was right, these should reflect national characteristics; the income-tax law,<br/>that is, should be to some extent a national mirror. How does the reflection look?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TO <span class="p">repeat, then, the basic law under which income taxes are now imposed is the Internal Revenue<br/>Code of 1954, as amplified by innumerable regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service,<br/>interpreted by innumerable judicial decisions, and amended by several Acts of Congress, including<br/>the Revenue Act of 1964, which embodied the biggest tax cut in our history. The Code, a document<br/>longer than “War and Peace,” is phrased—inevitably, perhaps—in the sort of jargon that stuns the<br/>mind and disheartens the spirit; a fairly typical sentence, dealing with the definition of the word<br/>“employment,” starts near the bottom of page 564, includes more than a thousand words, nineteen<br/>semicolons, forty-two simple parentheses, three parentheses within parentheses, and even one<br/>unaccountable interstitial period, and comes to a gasping end, with a definitive period, near the top of<br/>page 567. Not until one has penetrated to the part of the Code dealing with export-import taxes</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark102"><span>(which fall within its province, along with estate taxes and various other federal imposts) does one<br/>come upon a comprehensible and diverting sentence like “Every person who shall export<br/>oleomargarine shall brand upon every tub, firkin, or other package containing such article the word<br/>‘Oleomargarine,’ in plain Roman letters not less than one-half inch square.” Yet a clause on page 2 of<br/>the Code, though it is not a sentence at all, is as clear and forthright as one could wish; it sets forth<br/>without ado the rates at which the incomes of single individuals are to be taxed: 20 per cent on<br/>taxable income of not over $2,000; 22 per cent on taxable income of over $2,000 but not over $4,000;<br/>and so on up to a top rate of 91 per cent on taxable income of over $200,000. (As we have seen, the<br/>rates were amended downward in 1964 to a top of 70 per cent.) Right at the start, then, the Code<br/>makes its declaration of principle, and, to judge by the rate table, it is implacably egalitarian, taxing<br/>the poor relatively lightly, the well-to-do moderately, and the very rich at levels that verge on the<br/>confiscatory.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark103"><span>But, to repeat a point that has become so well known that it scarcely needs repeating, the Code<br/>does not live up to its principles very well. For proof of this, one need look no further than some of<br/>the recent score sheets of the income tax—a set of volumes entitled </span></a><i>Statistics of Income</i><span>, which are<br/>published annually by the Internal Revenue Service. For 1960, individuals with gross incomes of<br/>between $4,000 and $5,000, after taking advantage of all their deductions and personal exemptions,<br/>and availing themselves of the provision that allows married couples and the heads of households to<br/>be taxed at rates generally lower than those for single persons, ended up paying an average tax bill of<br/>about one-tenth of their reportable receipts, while those in the $10,000–$15,000 range paid a bill of<br/>about one-seventh, those in the $25,000–$50,000 range paid a bill of not quite a quarter, and those in<br/>the $50,000–$100,000 range paid a bill of about a third. Up to this point, clearly, we find a<br/>progression according to ability to pay, much as the rate table prescribes. However, the progression<br/>stops abruptly when we reach the top income brackets—that is, at just the point where it is supposed<br/>to become most marked. For 1960, the $150,000–$200,000, $200,000–$500,000, $500,000$<br/>1,000,000 and million-plus groups each paid, on the average, less than 50 per cent of their reportable<br/>incomes, and when one takes into consideration the fact that the richer a man is, the likelier it is that a<br/>huge proportion of his money need not even be reported as gross taxable income—all income from<br/>certain bonds, for example, and half of all income from long-term capital gains—it becomes evident<br/>that at the very top of the income scale the percentage rate of actual taxation turns downward. The<br/>evidence is confirmed by the </span><i>Statistics of Income </i><span>for 1961, which breaks down figures on payments<br/>according to bracket, and which shows that although 7,487 taxpayers declared gross incomes of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$200,000 or more, fewer than five hundred of them had net income that was taxed at the rate of 91 per<br/>cent. Throughout its life, the rate of 91 per cent was a public tranquilizer, making everyone in the<br/>lower bracket feel fortunate not to be rich, and not hurting the rich very much. And then, to top off the<br/>joke, if that is what it is, there are the people with more income than anyone else who pay less tax<br/>than anyone else—that is, those with annual incomes of a million dollars or more who manage to find<br/>perfectly legal ways of paying no income tax at all. According to </span><i>Statistics of Income</i><span>, there were<br/>eleven of them in 1960, out of a national total of three hundred and six million-a-year men, and<br/>seventeen in 1961, out of a total of three hundred and ninety-eight. In plain fact, the income tax is<br/>hardly progressive at all.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The explanation of this disparity between appearance and reality, so huge that it lays the Code open<br/>to  a broad accusation of hypocrisy, is to be found in the detailed exceptions to the standard rates<br/>which lurk in its dim depths—exceptions that are usually called special-interest provisions or, more<br/>bluntly, loopholes. (“Loophole,” as  all fair-minded users  of the word are ready to admit, is  a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>somewhat subjective designation, for one man’s loophole may be another man’s lifeline—or perhaps<br/>at some other time, the same man’s lifeline.) Loopholes were noticeably absent from the original<br/>1913 income-tax law. How they came to be law and why they remain law are questions involving<br/>politics and possibly metaphysics, but their actual workings are relatively simple, and are<br/>illuminating to watch. By far the simplest method of avoiding income taxes—at least for someone<br/>who has a large amount of capital at his disposal—is to invest in the bonds of states, municipalities,<br/>port authorities, and toll roads; the interest paid on all such bonds is unequivocally tax-exempt. Since<br/>the interest on high-grade tax-exempt bonds in recent years has run from three to five per cent, a man<br/>who invests ten million dollars in them can collect $300,000 to $500,000 a year tax-free without<br/>putting himself or his tax lawyer to the slightest trouble; if he had been foolish enough to sink the<br/>money in ordinary investments yielding, say, five per cent, he would have had a taxable income of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$500,000, and at the 1964 rate, assuming that he was single, had no other income, and did not avail<br/>himself of any dodges, he would have to pay taxes of almost $367,000. The exemption on state and<br/>municipal bonds has been part of our income-tax law since its beginnings; it was based originally on<br/>Constitutional grounds and is now defended on the ground that the states and towns need the money.<br/>Most Secretaries of the Treasury have looked on the exemption with disfavor, but not one has been<br/>able to accomplish its repeal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark104"><span>Probably the most important special-interest provision in the Code is the one that concerns capital<br/>gains. The staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress wrote in a report issued in 1961,<br/>“Capital gains treatment has become one of the most impressive loopholes in the federal revenue<br/>structure.” What the provision says, in essence, is that a taxpayer who makes a capital investment (in<br/>real estate, a corporation, a block of stock, or whatever), holds on to it for at least six months, and<br/>then sells it at a profit is entitled to be taxed on the profit at a rate much lower than the rate on<br/>ordinary income; to be specific, the rate is half of that taxpayer’s ordinary top tax rate or twenty-five<br/>per cent whichever is less. What this means to anyone whose income would normally put him in a<br/>very high tax bracket is obvious: he must find a way of getting as much as possible of that income in<br/>the form of capital gains. Consequently, the game of finding ways of converting ordinary income into<br/>capital gains has become very popular in the past decade or two. The game is often won without<br/>much of a struggle. On television one evening in the middle 1960s, David Susskind asked six<br/>assembled multimillionaires whether any of them considered tax rates a stumbling block on the<br/>highroad to wealth in America. There was a long silence, almost as if the notion were new to the<br/>multimillionaires, and then one of them, in the tone of some one explaining something to a child,<br/>mentioned the capital-gains provision and said that he didn’t consider taxes much of a problem. There<br/>was no more discussion of high tax rates that night.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark105"><span>If the capital-gains provision resembles the exemption on certain bonds in that the advantages it<br/>affords are of benefit chiefly to the rich, it differs in other ways. It is by far the more accommodating<br/>of the two loopholes; indeed, it is a sort of mother loophole capable of spawning other loopholes. For<br/>example, one might think that a taxpayer would need to have capital before he could have a capital<br/>gain. Yet a way was discovered—and was passed into law in 1950—for him to get the gain before he<br/>has the capital. This is the stock-option provision. Under its terms, a corporation may give its<br/>executives the right to buy its shares at any time within a stipulated period—say, five years—at or<br/>near the open-market price at the time of the granting of the option; later on, if, as has happened so<br/>often, the market price of the stock goes sky-high, the executives may exercise their options to buy the<br/>stock at the old price, may sell it on the open market some time later at the new price, and may pay<br/>only capital-gains rates on the difference, provided that they go through these motions without</span></a><a name="bookmark106">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>unseemly haste. The beauty of it all from an executive’s point of view is that once the stock has gone<br/>up substantially in value, his option itself becomes a valuable commodity, against which he can<br/>borrow the cash he needs in order to exercise it; then, having bought the stock and sold it again, he<br/>can pay off his debt and have a capital gain that has arisen from the investment of no capital. The<br/>beauty of it all from the corporations’ point of view is that they can compensate their executives<br/>partly in money taxable at relatively low rates. Of course, the whole scheme comes to nothing if the<br/>company’s stock goes down, which does happen occasionally, or if it simply doesn’t go up, but even<br/>then the executive has had a free play on the roulette wheel of the stock market, with a chance of<br/>winning a great deal and practically no danger of losing anything—something that the tax law offers<br/>no other group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark107"><span>By favoring capital gains over ordinary income, the Code seems to be putting forward two very<br/>dubious notions—that one form of unearned income is more deserving than any form of earned<br/>income, and that people with money to invest are more deserving than people without it. Hardly<br/>anyone contends that the favored treatment of capital gains can be justified on the ground of fairness;<br/>those who consider this aspect of the matter are apt to agree with Hellerstein, who has written, “From<br/>a sociological viewpoint, there is a good deal to be said for more severe taxation of profit from<br/>appreciation in the value of property than from personal-service income.” The defense, then, is based<br/>on other grounds. For one, there is a respectable economic theory that supports a complete exemption<br/>of capital gains from income tax, the argument being that whereas wages and dividends or interest<br/>from investments are fruits of the capital tree, and are therefore taxable income, capital gains<br/>represent the growth of the tree itself, and are therefore not income at all. This distinction is actually<br/>embedded in the tax laws of some countries—most notably in the tax law of Britain, which in<br/>principle did not tax capital gains until 1964. Another argument—this one purely pragmatic—has it<br/>that the capital-gains provision is necessary to encourage people to take risks with their capital.<br/>(Similarly, the advocates of stock options say that corporations need them to attract and hold<br/>executive talent.) Finally, nearly all tax authorities are agreed that taxing capital gains on exactly the<br/>same basis as other income, which is what most reformers say ought to be done, would involve<br/>formidable technical difficulties.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Particular subcategories of the rich and the well-paid can avail themselves of various other<br/>avenues of escape, including corporate pension plans, which, like stock options, contribute to the<br/>solution of the tax problems of executives; tax-free foundations set up ostensibly for charitable and<br/>educational purposes, of which over fifteen thousand help to ease the tax burdens of their benefactors,<br/>though the charitable and educational activities of some of them are more or less invisible; and<br/>personal holding companies, which, subject to rather strict regulations, enable persons with very high<br/>incomes from personal services like writing and acting to reduce their taxes by what amounts to<br/>incorporating themselves. Of the whole array of loopholes in the Code, however, probably the most<br/>widely loathed is the percentage depletion allowance on oil. As the word “depletion” is used in the<br/>Code, it refers to the progressive exhaustion of irreplaceable natural resources, but as used on<br/>oilmen’s tax returns, it proves to mean a miraculously glorified form of what is ordinarily called<br/>depreciation. Whereas a manufacturer may claim depreciation on a piece of machinery as a tax<br/>deduction only until he has deducted the original cost of the machine—until, that is, the machine is<br/>theoretically worthless from wear—an individual or corporate oil investor, for reasons that defy<br/>logical explanation, may go on claiming percentage depletion on a producing well indefinitely, even<br/>if this means that the original cost of the well has been recovered many times over. The oil-depletion<br/>allowance is 27.5 per cent a year up to a maximum of half of the oil investor’s net income (there are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark108"><span>smaller allowances on other natural resources, such as 23 per cent on uranium, 10 per cent on coal,<br/>and 5 per cent on oyster and clam shells), and the effect it has on the taxable income of an oil<br/>investor, especially when it is combined with the effects of other tax-avoidance devices, is truly<br/>astonishing; for instance, over a recent five-year period one oilman had a net income of fourteen and a<br/>third million dollars, on which he paid taxes of $80,000, or six-tenths of one per cent. Unsurprisingly,<br/>the percentage-depletion allowance is always under attack, but, also unsurprisingly, it is defended<br/>with tigerish zeal—so tigerish that even President Kennedy’s 1961 and 1963 proposals for tax<br/>revision, which, taken together, are generally considered the broadest program of tax reform ever put<br/>forward by a chief executive, did not venture to suggest its repeal. The usual argument is that the<br/>percentage-depletion allowance is needed in order to compensate oilmen for the risks involved in<br/>speculative drilling, and thus insure an adequate supply of oil for national use, but many people feel<br/>that this argument amounts to saying, “The depletion allowance is a necessary and desirable federal<br/>subsidy to the oil industry,” and thereby scuttles itself, since granting subsidies to individual<br/>industries is hardly the proper task of the income tax.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark109"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>1964 Revenue Act does practically nothing to plug the loopholes, but it does make them<br/>somewhat less useful, in that the drastic reduction of the basic rates on high incomes has probably led<br/>some high-bracket taxpayers simply to quit bothering with the less convenient or effective of the<br/>dodges. Insofar as the new bill reduces the disparity between the Code’s promises and its<br/>performance, that is, it represents a kind of adventitious reform. (One way to cure </span><i>all </i><span>income-tax<br/>evasion would be to repeal the income tax.) However, quite apart from the sophistry—since 1964<br/>happily somewhat lessened—that the Code embodies, it has certain discernible and disturbing<br/>characteristics that have not been changed and may be particularly hard to change in the future. Some<br/>of them have to do with its methods of allowing and disallowing deductions for travel and<br/>entertainment expenses by persons who are in business for themselves, or by persons who are<br/>employed but are not reimbursed for their business expenses—deductions that were estimated fairly<br/>recently at between five and ten billion dollars a year, with a resulting reduction in federal revenue of<br/>between one and two billion. The travel-and-entertainment problem—or the T &amp; E problem, as it is<br/>customarily called—has been around a long time, and has stubbornly resisted various attempts to<br/>solve it. One of the crucial points in T &amp; E history occurred in 1930, when the courts ruled that the<br/>actor and songwriter George M. Cohan—and therefore anyone else—was entitled to deduct his<br/>business expenses on the basis of a reasonable estimate even if he could not produce any proof of<br/>having paid that sum or even produce a detailed accounting. The Cohan rule, as it came to be called,<br/>remained  in effect for more than three decades, during which it was invoked every spring by<br/>thousands of businessmen as ritually as Moslems turn toward Mecca. Over those decades, estimated<br/>business deductions grew like kudzu vines as the estimators became bolder, with the result that the<br/>Cohan rule and other flexible parts of the T &amp; E regulations were subjected to a series of attacks by<br/>would-be reformers. Bills that would have virtually or entirely eliminated the Cohan rule were<br/>introduced in Congress in 1951 and again in 1959, only to be defeated—in one case, after an outcry<br/>that T &amp; E reform would mean the end of the Kentucky Derby—and in 1961 President Kennedy<br/>proposed legislation that not only would have swept aside the Cohan rule but, by reducing to between<br/>four and seven dollars a day the amount that a man could deduct for food and beverages, would have<br/>all but put an end to the era of deductibility in American life. No such fundamental social change took<br/>place. Loud and long wails of anguish instantly arose, from businessmen and also from hotels,<br/>restaurants, and night clubs, and many of the Kennedy proposals were soon abandoned. Nevertheless,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>through a series of amendments to the Code passed by Congress in 1962 and put into effect by a set of<br/>regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 1963, they did lead to the abrogation of the<br/>Cohan rule, and the stipulation that, generally speaking, all business deductions, no matter how small,<br/>would thenceforward have to be substantiated by records, if not by actual receipts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark110"><span>Yet even a cursory look at the law as it has stood since then shows that the new, reformed T &amp; E<br/>rules fall somewhat short of the ideal—that, in fact, they are shot through with absurdities and<br/>underlaid by a kind of philistinism. For travel to be deductible, it must be undertaken primarily for<br/>business rather than for pleasure and it must be “away from home”—that is to say, not merely<br/>commuting. The “away-from-home” stipulation raises the question of where home is, and leads to the<br/>concept of a “tax home,” the place one must be away from in order to qualify for travel deductions; a<br/>businessman’s tax home, no matter how many country houses, hunting lodges, and branch offices he<br/>may have, is the general area—not just the particular building, that is—of his principal place of<br/>employment. As a result, marriage partners who commute to work in two different cities  have<br/>separate tax homes, but, fortunately, the Code continues to recognize their union to the extent of<br/>allowing them the tax advantages available to other married people; although there have been tax<br/>marriages, the tax divorce still belongs to the future.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark111"><span>As for entertainment, now that the writers of I.R.S. regulations have been deprived of the far-<br/>reaching Cohan rule, they are forced to make distinctions of almost theological nicety, and the upshot<br/>of the distinctions is to put a direct premium on the habit—which some people have considered all<br/>too prevalent for many years anyhow—of talking business at all hours of the day and night, and in all<br/>kinds of company. For example, deductions are granted for the entertainment of business associates at<br/>night clubs, theatres, or concerts only if a “substantial and bona fide business discussion” takes place<br/>before, during, or after the entertainment. (One is reluctant to picture the results if businessmen take to<br/>carrying on business discussions in great numbers during plays or concerts.) On the other hand, a<br/>businessman who entertains another in a “quiet business setting,” such as a restaurant with no floor<br/>show, may claim a deduction even if little or no business is actually discussed, as long as the meeting<br/>has a business purpose. Generally speaking, the noisier and more confusing or distracting the setting,<br/>the more business talk there must be; the regulations specifically include cocktail parties in the noisy-<br/>and-distractingcategory, and, accordingly, require conspicuous amounts of business discussion<br/>before, during, or after them, though a meal served to a business associate at the host’s home may be<br/>deductible with no such discussion at all. In the latter case, however, as the J. K. Lasser Tax Institute<br/>cautions in its popular guide “Your Income Tax,” you must “be ready to prove that your motive …<br/>was commercial rather than social.” In other words, to be on the safe side, talk business anyhow.<br/>Hellerstein has written, “Henceforth, tax men will doubtless urge their clients to talk business at<br/>every turn, and will ask them to admonish their wives not to object to shop talk if they want to<br/>continue their accustomed style of living.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Entertainment on an elaborate scale is discouraged in the post-1963 rules, but, as the Lasser<br/>booklet notes, perhaps a little jubilantly, “Congress did not specifically put into law a provision<br/>barring lavish or extravagant entertainment.” Instead, it decreed that a businessman may deduct<br/>depreciation and operating expenses on an “entertainment facility”—a yacht, a hunting lodge, a<br/>swimming pool, a bowling alley, or an airplane, for instance—provided he uses it more than half the<br/>time for business. In a booklet entitled “Expense Accounts 1963,” which is one of many publications<br/>for the guidance of tax advisers that are issued periodically by Commerce Clearing House, Inc., the<br/>rule was explained by means of the following example:</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>A yacht is maintained … for the entertainment of customers. It is used 25% of the time for relaxation.… Since the yacht is used 75% of<br/>the time for business purposes, it is used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer’s business and 75% of the maintenance expenses</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">… are deductible entertainment facility expenses. If the yacht had been used only 40% for business, no deduction would be allowed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark112"><span>The method by which the yachtsman is to measure business time and pleasure time is not<br/>prescribed. Presumably, time when the yacht is in drydock or is in the water with only her crew<br/>aboard would count as neither, though it might be argued that the owner sometimes derives pleasure<br/>simply from watching her swing at anchor. The time to be apportioned, then, must be the time when he<br/>and some guests are aboard her, and perhaps his most efficient way of complying with the law would<br/>be to install two stopwatches, port and starboard, one to be kept running during business cruising and<br/>the other during pleasure cruising. Perhaps a favoring westerly might speed a social cruise home an<br/>hour early, or a September blow delay the last leg of a business cruise, and thus tip the season’s<br/>business time above the crucial fifty-percent figure. Well might the skipper pray for such timely<br/>winds, since the deductibility of his yacht could easily double his after-tax income for the year. In<br/>short, the law is nonsense.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Some experts feel that the change in T &amp; E regulations represents a gain for our society because<br/>quite a few taxpayers who may have been inclined to fudge a bit under general provisions like the<br/>Cohan rule do not have the stomach or the heart to put down specific fraudulent items. But what has<br/>been gained in the way of compliance may have been lost in a certain debasement of our national life.<br/>Scarcely ever has any part of the tax law tended so energetically to compel the commercialization of<br/>social intercourse, or penalized so particularly the amateur spirit, which, Richard Hofstadter declares<br/>in his book “Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,” characterized the founders of the republic.<br/>Perhaps the greatest danger of all is that, by claiming deductions for activities that are technically<br/>business but actually social—that is, by complying with the letter of the law—a man may cheapen his<br/>life in his own eyes. One might argue that the founders, if they were alive today, would scornfully<br/>decline to mingle the social and the commercial, the amateur and the professional, and would disdain<br/>to claim any but the most unmistakable expenses. But, under the present tax laws, the question would<br/>be whether they could afford such a lordly overpayment of taxes, or should even be asked to make the<br/>choice.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark113">IT </a><span class="p">has been maintained that the Code discriminates against intellectual work, the principal evidence<br/>being that while depreciation may be claimed on all kinds of exhaustible physical property and<br/>depletion may be claimed on natural resources, no such deductions are allowed in the case of<br/>exhaustion of the mental or imaginative capacities of creative artists and inventors—even though the<br/>effects of brain fag are sometimes all too apparent in the later work and incomes of such persons. (It<br/>has also been argued that professional athletes are discriminated against, in that the Code does not<br/>allow for depreciation of their bodies.) Organizations like the Authors League of America have<br/>contended, further, that the Code is unfair to authors and other creative people whose income,<br/>because of the nature of their work and the economics of its marketing, is apt to fluctuate wildly from<br/>year to year, so that they are taxed exorbitantly in good years and are left with too little to tide them<br/>over bad years. A provision of the 1964 bill intended to take care of this situation provided creative<br/>artists, inventors, and other receivers of sudden large income with a four-year averaging formula to<br/>ease the tax bite of a windfall year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">But if the Code <i>is </i><span>anti-intellectual, it is probably so only inadvertently—and is certainly so only<br/>inconsistently. By granting tax-exempt status to charitable foundations, it facilitates the award of<br/>millions of dollars a year—most of which would otherwise go into the government’s coffers—to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark114"><span>scholars for travel and living expenses while they carry out research projects of all kinds. And by<br/>making special provisions in respect to gifts of property that has appreciated in value, it has—<br/>whether advertently or inadvertently—tended not only to force up the prices that painters and<br/>sculptors receive for their work but to channel thousands of works out of private collections and into<br/>public museums. The mechanics of this process are by now so well known that they need be merely<br/>outlined: a collector who donates a work of art to a museum may deduct on his income-tax return the<br/>fair value of the work at the time of the donation, and need pay no capital-gains tax on any increase in<br/>its value since the time he bought it. If the increase in value has been great and the collector’s tax<br/>bracket is very high, he may actually come out ahead on the deal. Besides burying some museums<br/>under such an avalanche of bounty that their staffs are kept busy digging themselves out, these<br/>provisions have tended to bring back into existence that lovable old figure from the pre-tax past, the<br/>rich dilettante. In recent years, some high-bracket people have fallen into the habit of making serial<br/>collections—Post-Impressionists for a few years, perhaps, followed by Chinese jade, and then by<br/>modern American painting. At the end of each period, the collector gives away his entire collection,<br/>and when the taxes he would otherwise have paid are calculated, the adventure is found to have cost<br/>him practically nothing.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The low cost of high-income people’s charitable contributions, whether in the form of works of art<br/>or simply in the form of money and other property, is one of the oddest fruits of the Code. Of<br/>approximately five billion dollars claimed annually as deductible contributions on personal income-<br/>tax returns, by far the greater part is in the form of assets of one sort or another that have appreciated<br/>in value, and comes from persons with very high incomes. The reasons can be made clear by a simple<br/>example: A man with a top bracket of 20 per cent who gives away $1,000 in cash incurs a net cost of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$800. A man with a top bracket of 60 per cent who gives away the same sum in cash incurs a net cost<br/>of $400. If, instead, this same high-bracket man gives $1,000 in the form of stock that he originally<br/>bought for $200, he incurs a net cost of only $200. It is the Code’s enthusiastic encouragement of<br/>large-scale charity that has led to most of the cases of million-dollar-a-year men who pay no tax at<br/>all; under one of its most peculiar provisions, anyone whose income tax and contributions combined<br/>have amounted to nine-tenths or more of his taxable income for eight out of the ten preceding years is<br/>entitled by way of reward to disregard in the current year the usual restrictions on the amount of<br/>deductible contributions, and can escape the tax entirely.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark115"><span>Thus the Code’s provisions often enable mere fiscal manipulation to masquerade as charity,<br/>substantiating a frequent charge that the Code is morally muddleheaded, or worse. The provisions<br/>also give rise to muddleheadedness in others. The appeal made by large fund-raising drives in recent<br/>years, for example, has been uneasily divided between a call to good works and an explanation of the<br/>tax advantages to the donor. An instructive example is a commendably thorough booklet entitled<br/>“Greater Tax Savings … A Constructive Approach,” which was used by Princeton in a large capital-<br/>funds drive. (Similar, not to say nearly identical, booklets have been used by Harvard, Yale, and<br/>many other institutions.) “The responsibilities of leadership are great, particularly in an age when<br/>statesmen, scientists, and economists must make decisions which will almost certainly affect mankind<br/>for generations to come,” the pamphlet’s foreword starts out, loftily, and goes on to explain, “The<br/>chief purpose of this booklet is to urge all prospective donors to give more serious thought to the<br/>manner in which they make their gifts.… There are many different ways in which substantial gifts can<br/>be made at comparatively low cost to the donor. It is important that prospective donors acquaint<br/>themselves with these opportunities.” The opportunities expounded in the subsequent pages include<br/>ways of saving on taxes through gifts of appreciated securities, industrial property, leases, royalties,</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>jewelry, antiques, stock options, residences, life insurance, and inventory items, and through the use<br/>of trusts (“The trust approach has great versatility”). At one point, the suggestion is put forward that,<br/>instead of actually giving anything away, the owner of appreciated securities may wish to </span><i>sell </i><span>them to<br/>Princeton, for cash, at the price he originally paid for them; this might appear to the simple-minded to<br/>be a commercial transaction, but the booklet points out, accurately, that in the eyes of the Code the<br/>difference between the securities’ current market value and the lower price at which they are sold to<br/>Princeton represents pure charity, and is fully deductible as such. “While we have laid heavy<br/>emphasis on the importance of careful tax planning,” the final paragraph goes, “we hope no inference<br/>will be drawn that the thought and spirit of giving should in any way be subordinated to tax<br/>considerations.” Indeed it should not, nor need it be; with the heavy substance of giving so deftly<br/>minimized, or actually removed, its spirit can surely fly unrestrained.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark116">ONE </a><span class="p">of the most marked traits of the Code—to bring this ransacking of its character to a close—is its<br/>complexity, and this complexity is responsible for some of its most far-reaching social effects; it is a<br/>virtual necessity for many taxpayers to seek professional help if they want to minimize their taxes<br/>legally, and since first-rate advice is expensive and in short supply, the rich are thereby given still<br/>another advantage over the poor, and the Code becomes more undemocratic in its action than it is in<br/>its provisions. (And the fact that fees for tax advice are themselves deductible means that tax advice<br/>is one more item on the long list of things that cost less and less to those who have more and more.)<br/>All the free projects of taxpayer education and taxpayer assistance offered by the Internal Revenue<br/>Service—and they are extensive and well meant—cannot begin to compete with the paid services of<br/>a good independent tax expert, if only because the I.R.S., whose first duty is to collect revenue, is<br/>involved in an obvious conflict of interest when it sets about explaining to people how to avoid taxes.<br/>The fact that about half of all the revenue derived from individual returns for 1960 came from<br/>adjusted gross incomes of $9,000 or less is not attributable entirely to provisions of the Code; in part,<br/>it results from the fact that low-income taxpayers cannot afford to be shown how to pay less.</span><a name="bookmark117">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark118"><span>The huge army of people who give tax advice—“practitioners,” they are called in the trade—is a<br/>strange and disturbing side effect of the Code’s complexity. The exact size of this army is unknown,<br/>but there are a few guideposts. By a recent count some eighty thousand persons, most of them lawyers,<br/>accountants, and former I.R.S. employees, held cards, granted by the Treasury Department, that<br/>officially entitle them to practice the trade of tax adviser and to appear as such before the I.R.S.; in<br/>addition, there is an uncounted host of unlicensed, and often unqualified, persons who prepare tax<br/>returns for a fee—a service that  anyone may legally perform. As for lawyers, the undisputed<br/>plutocrats, if not the undisputed aristocrats, of the tax-advice industry, there is scarcely a lawyer in<br/>the country who is not concerned with taxes at one time or another during a year’s practice, and every<br/>year there are more lawyers who are concerned with nothing else. The American Bar Association’s<br/>taxation section, composed mostly of nothing-but-tax lawyers, has some nine thousand members; in<br/>the typical large New York law firm one out of five lawyers devotes all of his time to tax matters; and<br/>the New York University Law School’s tax department, an enormous brood hen for the hatching of tax<br/>lawyers, is larger than the whole of an average law school. The brains that go into tax avoidance,<br/>which are generally recognized as including some of the best legal brains extant, constitute a wasted<br/>national resource, it is widely contended—and this contention is cheerfully upheld by some leading<br/>tax lawyers, who seem only too glad to affirm, first, that their mental capacities are indeed<br/>exceptional, and, second, that these capacities are indeed being squandered on trivia. “The law has<br/>its cycles,” one of them explained recently. “In the United States, the big thing until about 1890 was</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>property law. Then came a period when it was corporation law, and now it’s various specialties, of<br/>which the most important is taxes. I’m perfectly willing to admit that I’m engaged in work that has a<br/>limited social value. After all, what are we talking about when we talk about tax law? At best, only<br/>the question of what an individual or a corporation should fairly pay in support of the government. All<br/>right, why do I do tax work? In the first place, it’s a fascinating intellectual game—along with<br/>litigation, probably the most intellectually challenging branch of the law as it is now practiced. In the<br/>second place, although it’s specialized in one sense, in another sense it isn’t. It cuts through every<br/>field of law. One day you may be working with a Hollywood producer, the next day with a big real-<br/>estate man, the next with a corporation executive. In the third place, it’s a highly lucrative field.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HYPOCRITICALLY <span class="p">egalitarian on the surface and systematically oligarchic underneath, unconscionably<br/>complicated, whimsically discriminatory, specious in its reasoning, pettifogging in its language,<br/>demoralizing to charity, an enemy of discourse, a promoter of shop talk, a squanderer of talent, a rock<br/>of support to the property owner but a weighty onus to the underpaid, an inconstant friend to the artist<br/>and scholar—if the national mirror-image is all these things, it has its good points as well. Certainly<br/>no conceivable income-tax law could please everybody, and probably no equitable one could entirely<br/>please anybody; Louis Eisenstein notes in his book “The Ideologies of Taxation,” “Taxes are a<br/>changing product of the earnest effort to have others pay them.” With the exception of its more flagrant<br/>special-interest provisions, the Code seems to be a sincerely written document—at worst misguided</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark119"><span>—that is aimed at collecting unprecedented amounts of money from an unprecedentedly complex<br/>society in the fairest possible way, at encouraging the national economy, and at promoting worthy<br/>undertakings. When it is intelligently and conscientiously administered, as it has been of late, our<br/>national income-tax law is quite possibly as equitable as any in the world.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>But to enact an unsatisfactory law and  then try to compensate for its shortcomings by good<br/>administration is, clearly, an absurd procedure. One solution that is more logical—to abolish the<br/>income tax—is proposed chiefly by some members of the radical right, who consider any income tax<br/>Socialistic or Communistic, and who would have the federal government simply stop spending<br/>money, though abolition is also advanced, as a theoretical ideal rather than as a practical possibility,<br/>by certain economists who are looking around for alternative ways of raising at least a significant<br/>fraction of the sums now produced by the income tax. One such alternative is a value-added tax, under<br/>which manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers would be taxed on the difference between the value<br/>of the goods they bought and that of the goods they sold; among the advantages claimed for it are that<br/>it would spread the tax burden more evenly through the productive process than a business-income tax<br/>does, and that it would enable the government to get its money sooner. Several countries, including<br/>France and Germany, have value-added taxes, though as supplements rather than alternatives to<br/>income taxes, but no federal tax of the sort is more than remotely in prospect in this country. Other<br/>suggested means of lightening the burden of the income tax are to increase the number of items subject<br/>to excise taxes, and apply a uniform rate to them, so as to create what would amount to a federal sales<br/>tax; to increase user taxes, such as tolls on federally owned bridges and recreation facilities; and to<br/>enact a law permitting federal lotteries, like the lotteries that were permitted from colonial times up<br/>to 1895, which helped finance such projects as the building of Harvard, the fighting of the<br/>Revolutionary War, and the building of many schools, bridges, canals, and roads. One obvious<br/>disadvantage of all these schemes is that they would collect revenue with relatively little regard to<br/>ability to pay, and for this reason or others none of them stand a chance of being enacted in the<br/>foreseeable future.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark120"><span>A special favorite of theoreticians, but of hardly anyone else, is something called the expenditure<br/>tax—the  taxing of individuals on the basis of their total annual expenditures rather than on their<br/>income. The proponents of this tax—diehard adherents of the economics of scarcity—argue that it<br/>would have the primary virtue of simplicity; that it would have the beneficial effect of encouraging<br/>savings; that it would be fairer than the income tax, because it would tax what people took out of the<br/>economy rather than what they put into it; and that it would give the government a particularly handy<br/>control instrument with which to keep the national economy on an even keel. Its opponents contend<br/>that it wouldn’t really be simple at all, and would be ridiculously easy to evade; that it would cause<br/>the rich to become richer, and doubtless stingier as well; and, finally, that by putting a penalty on<br/>spending it would promote depression. In any event, both sides concede that its enactment in the<br/>United States is not now politically practicable. An expenditure tax was seriously proposed for the<br/>United States by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in 1942, and for Britain by a<br/>Cambridge economist (later a special adviser to the National Treasury) named Nicholas Kaldor, in<br/>1951, though neither proponent asked for repeal of the income tax. Both proposals were all but<br/>unanimously hooted down. “The expenditure tax is a beautiful thing to contemplate,” one of its<br/>admirers said recently. “It would avoid almost all the pitfalls of the income tax. But it’s a dream.”<br/>And so it is, in the Western world; such a tax has been put in effect only in India and Ceylon.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark121"><span>With no feasible substitute in sight, then, the income tax seems to be here to stay, and any hope for<br/>better taxation seems to lie in its reform. Since one of the Code’s chief flaws is its complexity, reform<br/>might well start with that. Efforts at simplification have been made with regularity since 1943, when<br/>Secretary Morgenthau set up a committee to study the subject, and there have been occasional small<br/>successes; simplified instructions, for example, and a shortened form for taxpayers who wish to<br/>itemize deductions but whose affairs are relatively uncomplicated were both introduced during the<br/>Kennedy administration. Obviously, though, these were mere guerrilla-skirmish victories. One<br/>obstacle to  any victory more sweeping is the fact that many of the Code’s complexities were<br/>introduced in no interest other than that of fairness to all, and apparently cannot be removed without<br/>sacrificing fairness. The evolution of the special family-support provisions provides a striking<br/>example of how the quest for equity sometimes leads straight to complexity. Up to 1948, the fact that<br/>some states had and some didn’t have community-property laws resulted in an advantage to married<br/>couples in the community-property states; those couples, and those couples only, were allowed to be<br/>taxed as if their total income were divided equally between them, even though one spouse might<br/>actually have a high income and the other none at all. To correct this clear-cut inequity, the federal<br/>Code was modified to extend the income-dividing privilege to all married persons. Even apart from<br/>the resulting discrimination against single persons without dependents—which remains enshrined and<br/>unchallenged in the Code today—this correction of one inequity led to the creation of another, the<br/>correction of which led to still another; before the Chinese-box sequence was played out, account had<br/>been taken of the legitimate special problems of persons who had family responsibilities although<br/>they were not married, then of working wives with expenses for child care during business hours, and<br/>then of widows and widowers. And each change made the Code more complex.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The loopholes are another matter. In their case, complexity serves not equity but its opposite, and<br/>their persistent survival constitutes a puzzling paradox; in a system under which the majority<br/>presumably makes the laws, tax provisions that blatantly favor tiny minorities over everybody else<br/>would seem to represent the civil-rights principle run wild—a kind of anti-discrimination program<br/>for the protection of millionaires. The process by which new tax legislation comes into being—an<br/>original proposal from the Treasury Department or some other source, passage in turn by the House</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark122"><span>Ways and Means Committee, the whole House, the Senate Finance Committee, and the whole Senate,<br/>followed by the working out of a House-Senate compromise by a conference committee, followed by<br/>repassage by the House and the Senate and, finally, followed by signing by the President—is indeed a<br/>tortuous one, at any stage of which a bill may be killed or shelved. However, though the public has<br/>plenty of opportunity to protest special-interest provisions, what public pressure there is is apt to be<br/>greater in favor of them than against them. In the book on tax loopholes called “The Great Treasury<br/>Raid,” Philip M. Stern points out several forces that seem to him to work against the enactment of tax-<br/>reform measures, among them the skill, power, and organization of the anti-reform lobbies; the<br/>diffuseness and political impotence of the pro-reform forces within the government; and the<br/>indifference of the general public, which expresses practically no enthusiasm for tax reform through<br/>letters to congressmen or by any other means, perhaps in large part because it is stunned into<br/>incomprehension and consequent silence by the mind-boggling technicality of the whole subject. In<br/>this sense, the Code’s complexity is its impenetrable elephant hide. Thus the Treasury Department,<br/>which, as the agency charged with collecting federal revenues, has a natural interest in tax reform, is<br/>often left, along with a handful of reform-minded legislators, like Senators Paul H. Douglas of<br/>Illinois, Albert Gore of Tennessee, and Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, on a lonely and<br/>indefensible salient.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">OPTIMISTS <span class="p">believe that some “point of crisis” will eventually cause specially favored groups to look<br/>beyond their selfish interests, and the rest of the country to overcome its passivity, to such an extent<br/>that the income tax will come to give back a more flattering picture of the country than it does now.<br/>When this will happen, if ever, they do not specify. But the general shape of the picture hoped for by<br/>some of those who care most about it is known. The ideal income tax envisioned for the far future by<br/>many reformers would be characterized by a short and simple Code with comparatively low rates and<br/>with a minimum of exceptions to them. In its main structural features, this ideal tax would bear a<br/>marked resemblance to the 1913 income tax—the first ever to be put in effect in the United States in<br/>peacetime. So if the unattainable visions of today should eventually materialize, the income tax would<br/>be just about back where it started.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark123">4</a><a name="bookmark124">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark125">A Reasonable Amount of Time</a><a name="bookmark126">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark127"><span class="s6">PRIVATE INFORMATION, </span></a><span>whether of distant public events, impending business developments, or even<br/>the health of political figures, has always been a valuable commodity to traders in securities—so<br/>valuable that some commentators have suggested that stock exchanges are markets for such<br/>information just as much as for stocks. The money value that a market puts on information is often<br/>precisely measurable in terms of the change in stock prices that it brings about, and the information is<br/>almost as readily convertible into money as any other commodity; indeed, to the extent that it is used<br/>for barter between traders, it </span><i>is </i><span>a kind of money. Moreover, until quite recently, the propriety of the<br/>use of inside dope for their own enrichment by those fortunate enough to possess it went largely<br/>unquestioned. Nathan Rothschild’s judicious use of advance news of Wellington’s victory at<br/>Waterloo was the chief basis of the Rothschild fortune in England, and no Royal commission or<br/>enraged public rose to protest; similarly, and almost simultaneously, on this side of the Atlantic John<br/>Jacob Astor made an unchallenged bundle on advance news of the Ghent treaty ending the War of<br/>1812. In the post-Civil War era in the United States the members of the investing public, such as it<br/>was, still docilely accepted the right of the insider to trade on his privileged knowledge, and were<br/>content to pick up any crumbs that he might drop along the way. (Daniel Drew, a vintage insider,<br/>cruelly denied them even this consolation by dropping poisoned crumbs in the form of misleading<br/>memoranda as to his investment plans, which he would elaborately strew in public places.) Most<br/>nineteenth-century American fortunes were enlarged by, if they were not actually founded on, the<br/>practice of insider trading, and just how different our present social and economic order would be if<br/>such trading had been effectively forbidden in those days provides a subject for fascinating, if<br/>bootless, speculation. Not until 1910 did anyone publicly question the morality of corporate officers,<br/>directors, and employees trading in the shares of their own companies, not until the nineteen twenties<br/>did it come to be widely thought of as outrageous that such persons should be permitted to play the<br/>market game with what amounts to a stacked deck, and not until 1934 did Congress pass legislation<br/>intended to restore equity. The legislation, the Securities Exchange Act, requires corporate insiders to<br/>forfeit to their corporations any profits they may realize on short-term trades in their own firms’<br/>stock, and provides further, in a section that was implemented in 1942 by a rule designated as 10B-5,<br/>that no stock trader may use any scheme to defraud or “make any untrue statement of a material fact or</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">… omit to state a material fact.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark128"><span>Since omitting to state material facts is the essence of using inside information, the law—while it<br/>does not forbid insiders to buy their own stock, nor to keep the profits provided they hold onto the<br/>stock more than six months—would seem to outlaw the stacked deck. In practice, though, until very<br/>recently the 1942 rule was treated almost as if it didn’t exist; it was invoked by the Securities and<br/>Exchange Commission, the federal enforcement body set up under the Securities Exchange Act, only</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>rarely and in cases so flagrant as to be probably prosecutable even without it, under common law.<br/>And there were apparent reasons for this laxity. For one thing, it has been widely argued that the<br/>privilege of cashing in on their corporate secrets is a necessary incentive to business executives to<br/>goad them to their best efforts, and it is coolly contended by a few authorities that the uninhibited<br/>presence of insiders in the market, however offensive to the spirit of fair play, is essential to a<br/>smooth, orderly flow of trading. Moreover, it is contended that the majority of all stock traders,<br/>whether or not they are technically insiders, possess and conceal inside information of one sort or<br/>another, or at least hope and believe that they do, and that therefore an even-handed application of<br/>Rule 10B-5 would result in nothing less than chaos on Wall Street. So in letting the rule rest largely<br/>untroubled in the rulebook for twenty years, the S.E.C. seemed to be consciously refraining from<br/>hitting Wall Street in one of its most vulnerable spots. But then, after a couple of preliminary jabs, it<br/>went for the spot with a vengeance. The lawsuit in which it did so was a civil complaint against the<br/>Texas Gulf Sulphur Company and thirteen men who were directors or employees of that company; it<br/>was tried without a jury in the United States District Court in Foley Square on May 9th through June<br/>21st, 1966, and as the presiding judge, Dudley J. Bonsal, remarked mildly at one point during the<br/>trial, “I guess we all agree that we are plowing new ground here to some extent.” Plowing, and<br/>perhaps sowing too; Henry G. Manne, in a recent book entitled “Insider Trading and the Stock<br/>Market,” says that the case presents in almost classic terms the whole problem of insider trading, and<br/>expresses the opinion that its resolution “may determine the law in this field for many years to come.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark129">THE </a><span class="p">events that led to the S.E.C.’s action began in March, 1959, when Texas Gulf, a New York City-<br/>based company that was the world’s leading producer of sulphur, began conducting aerial<br/>geophysical surveys over the Canadian Shield, a vast, barren, forbidding area of eastern Canada that<br/>in the distant but not forgotten past had proved to be a fertile source of gold. What the Texas Gulf<br/>airmen were looking for was neither sulphur nor gold. Rather, it was sulphides—deposits of sulphur<br/>occurring in chemical combination with other useful minerals, such as zinc and copper. What they had<br/>in mind was discovering mineable veins of such minerals so that Texas Gulf could diversify its<br/>activities and be less dependent upon sulphur, the market price of which had been slipping. From time<br/>to time during the two years that the surveys went on intermittently, the geophysical instruments in the<br/>scanning planes would behave strangely, their needles jiggling in such a way as to indicate the<br/>presence of electrically conductive material in the earth. The areas where such things happened,<br/>called “anomalies” by geophysicists, were duly logged and mapped by the surveyors. All told,<br/>several thousand anomalies were found. It’s a long way from an anomaly to a workable mine, as must<br/>be evident to anyone who knows that while most sulphides are electrically conductive, so are many<br/>other things, including graphite, the worthless pyrites called fool’s gold, and even water;<br/>nevertheless, several hundred of the anomalies that the Texas Gulf men had found were considered to<br/>be worthy of ground investigation, and among the most promising-looking of all was one situated at a<br/>place designated on their maps as the Kidd-55 segment—one square mile of muskeg marsh, lightly<br/>wooded and almost devoid of outcropping rocks, about fifteen miles north of Timmins, Ontario, an<br/>old gold-mining town that is itself some three hundred and fifty miles northwest of Toronto. Since<br/>Kidd-55 was privately owned, the company’s first problem was to get title to it, or to enough of it to<br/>make possible exploratory ground operations; for a large company to acquire land in an area where it<br/>is known to be engaged in mining exploration obviously involves delicacy in the extreme, and it was<br/>not until June, 1963, that Texas Gulf was able to get an option permitting it to drill on the northeast<br/>quarter section of Kidd-55. On October 29th and 30th of that year a Texas Gulf engineer, Richard H.</span><a name="bookmark130">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Clayton, conducted a ground electromagnetic survey of the northeast quarter, and was satisfied with<br/>what he found. A drill rig was moved to the site, and on November 8th, the first test drill hole was<br/>begun.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>There followed a thrilling, if uncomfortable, several days at Kidd-55. The man in charge of the<br/>drilling crew was a young Texas Gulf geologist named Kenneth Darke, a cigar smoker with a rakish<br/>gleam in his eye, who looked a good deal more like the traditional notion of a mining prospector than<br/>that of the organization man he was. For three days the drilling went on, bringing out of the earth a<br/>cylindrical core of material an inch and a quarter in diameter, which served as the first actual sample<br/>of what the rock under Kidd-55 contained. As the core came up, Darke studied it critically, inch by<br/>inch and foot by foot, using no instruments but only his eyes and his knowledge of what various<br/>mineral deposits look like in their natural state. On the evening of Sunday, November 10th, by which<br/>time the drill was down one hundred and fifty feet, Darke telephoned his immediate superior, Walter<br/>Holyk, Texas Gulf’s chief geologist, at his home in Stamford, Conn. to report on his findings so far.<br/>(He made the call from Timmins, since there was no telephone at the Kidd-55 drill site.) Darke,<br/>Holyk has since said, was “excited.” And so, apparently, was Holyk after he had heard what Darke<br/>had to say, because he immediately set in motion quite a corporate flap for a Sunday night. That same<br/>evening, Holyk called his superior, Richard D. Mollison, a Texas Gulf vice president who lived near<br/>Holyk in Greenwich, and—still the same evening—Mollison called </span><i>his </i><span>boss, Charles F. Fogarty,<br/>executive vice president and the company’s No. 2 man, in nearby Rye, to pass Darke’s report on up<br/>the line. Further reports were made the next day through the same labyrinth of command—Darke to<br/>Holyk to Mollison to Fogarty. As a result of them, Holyk, Mollison, and Fogarty all decided to go to<br/>Kidd-55 to see for themselves.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark131"><span>Holyk got there first; he arrived at Timmins on November 12th, checked in at the Bon Air Motel,<br/>and got out to Kidd-55 by jeep and muskeg tractor in time to see the completion of the drill hole and<br/>to help Darke visually estimate and log the core. By this time the weather, which had hitherto been<br/>passable for Timmins in mid-November, had turned nasty. In fact, it was “quite inclement,” Holyk, a<br/>Canadian in his forties with a doctorate in geology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has<br/>since said. “It was cold, windy, threatening snow and rain, and … we were much more concerned<br/>with personal comfort than we were with the details of the core hole. Ken Darke was writing, and I<br/>was looking at the core, trying to make estimates of the mineral content.” To add to the difficulty of<br/>working outdoors under such conditions, some of the core had come out of the ground covered with<br/>dirt and grease, and had to be washed with gasoline before its contents could even be guessed at.<br/>Despite all difficulties, Holyk succeeded in making an appraisal of the core that was, to say the least,<br/>startling. Over the six hundred or so feet of its final length, he estimated, there appeared to be an<br/>average copper content of 1.15% and an average zinc content of 8.64%. A Canadian stockbroker with<br/>special knowledge of the mining industry was to say later that a drill core of such length and such<br/>mineral content “is just beyond your wildest imagination.”</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TEXAS <span class="p">Gulf didn’t have a surefire mine yet; there was always the possibility that the mineral vein was<br/>a long, thin one, too limited to be commercially exploitable, and that by a fantastic chance the drill<br/>had happened to go “down dip”—that is, straight into the vein like a sword into a sheath. What was<br/>needed was a pattern of several drill holes, beginning at different spots on the surface and entering the<br/>earth at different angles, to establish the shape and limits of the deposit. And such a pattern could not<br/>be made until Texas Gulf had title to the other three quarter-segments of Kidd-55. Getting title would<br/>take time if it were possible at all, but meanwhile, there were several steps that the company could</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark132"><span>and did take. The drill rig was moved away from the site of the test hole. Cut saplings were stuck in<br/>the ground around the hole, to restore the appearance of the place to a semblance of its natural state.<br/>A second test hole was drilled, as ostentatiously as possible, some distance away, at a place where a<br/>barren core was expected—and found. All of these camouflage measures, which were in conformity<br/>with long-established practice among miners who suspect that they have made a strike, were<br/>supplemented by an order from Texas Gulf’s president, Claude O. Stephens, that no one outside the<br/>actual exploration group, even within the company, should be told what had been found. Late in<br/>November, the core was shipped off, in sections, to the Union Assay Office in Salt Lake City for<br/>scientific analysis of its contents. And meanwhile, of course, Texas Gulf began discreetly putting out<br/>feelers for the purchase of the rest of Kidd-55.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And meanwhile other measures, which may or may not have been related to the events north of<br/>Timmins, were being taken. On November 12th, Fogarty bought three hundred shares of Texas Gulf<br/>stock; on the 15th he added seven hundred more shares, on November 19th five hundred more, and on<br/>November 26th two hundred more. Clayton bought two hundred on the 15th, Mollison one hundred on<br/>the same day; and </span><i>Mrs</i><span>. Holyk bought fifty on the 29th and one hundred more on December 10th. But<br/>these purchases, as things turned out, were only the harbingers of a period of apparently intense<br/>affection for Texas Gulf stock among certain of its officers and employees, and even some of their<br/>friends. In mid-December, the report on the core came back from Salt Lake City, and it showed that<br/>Holyk’s rough-and-ready estimate had been amazingly accurate; the copper and zinc contents were<br/>found to be almost exactly what he had said, and there were 3.94 ounces of silver per ton thrown in as<br/>a sort of bonus. Late in December, Darke made a trip to Washington, D.C. and vicinity, where he<br/>recommended Texas Gulf stock to a girl he knew there and her mother; these two, who came to be<br/>designated in the trial as the “tippees,” subsequently passed along the recommendation to two other<br/>persons who, logically enough, thereby became the “sub-tippees.” Between December 30th and the<br/>following February 17th, Darke’s tippees and sub-tippees purchased all told 2,100 shares of Texas<br/>Gulf stock, and in addition they purchased what are known in the brokerage trade as “calls” on 1,500<br/>additional shares. A call is an option to buy a stated amount of a certain stock at a fixed price—<br/>generally near the current market price—at any time during a stated period. Calls on most listed<br/>stocks are always on sale by dealers who specialize in them. The purchaser pays a generally rather<br/>moderate sum for his option; if the stock then goes up during the stated period, the rise can easily be<br/>converted into almost pure profit for him, while if the stock stays put or goes down, he simply tears<br/>up his call the way a horseplayer tears up a losing ticket, and loses nothing but the cost of the call.<br/>Therefore calls provide the cheapest possible way of gambling on the stock market, and the most<br/>convenient way of converting inside information into cash.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Back in Timmins, Darke, put temporarily out of business as a geologist by the winter freeze and the<br/>land-ownership problem at Kidd-55, seems to have managed to keep time from hanging heavy on his<br/>hands. In January, he entered into a private partnership with another Timmins man who wasn’t a<br/>Texas Gulf employee to stake and claim Crown lands around Timmins for their own benefit. In<br/>February, he told Holyk of a barroom conversation that had occurred in Timmins one gelid winter<br/>evening, in which an acquaintance of his had let fall that he’d heard rumors of a Texas Gulf strike<br/>nearby and was therefore going to stake a few claims of his own. Horrified, Holyk, as he recalled<br/>later, told Darke to reverse the previous policy of avoiding Kidd-55 like the plague, and to “go right<br/>into the … area and stake all the claims we need;” also to “steer away this acquaintance. Give him a<br/>helicopter ride or anything, just get him out of the way.” Darke presumably complied with this order.<br/>Moreover, during the first three months of 1964 he bought three hundred shares of Texas Gulf</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>outright, bought calls on three thousand more shares, and added several more persons, one of them his<br/>brother, to his growing list of tippees. Holyk and Clayton were somewhat less financially active<br/>during the same period, but they did add substantially to their Texas Gulf holdings—in the case of<br/>Holyk and his wife, particularly through the use of calls, which they’d scarcely even heard of before,<br/>but which were getting to be quite the rage in Texas Gulf circles.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Signs of spring began to come at last, and with them came a triumphant conclusion to the<br/>company’s land acquisition program. By March 27th, Texas Gulf had pretty much what it needed; that<br/>is, it had either clear title or mineral rights to the three remaining segments of Kidd-55, except for ten-<br/>per-cent profit concessions on two of the segments, the stubborn owner of the concession in one case<br/>being the Curtis Publishing Company. After a final burst of purchases by Darke, his tippees, and his<br/>sub-tippees on March 30th and 31st (among them all, six hundred shares and calls on 5,100 more<br/>shares for the two days), drilling was resumed in the still-frozen muskeg at Kidd-55, with Holyk and<br/>Darke both on the site this time. The new hole—the third in all, but only the second operational one,<br/>since one of the two drilled in November had been the dummy intended to create a diversion—was<br/>begun at a point some distance from the first and at an oblique angle to it, to advance the bracketing<br/>process. Observing and logging the core as it came out of the ground, Holyk found that he could<br/>scarcely hold a pencil because of the cold; but he must have been warmed inwardly by the fact that<br/>promising mineralization began to appear after the first hundred feet. He made his first progress<br/>report to Fogarty by telephone on April 1st. Now a gruelling daily routine was adopted at Timmins<br/>and Kidd-55. The actual drilling crew stayed at the site continuously, while the geologists, in order to<br/>keep their superiors in New York posted, had to make frequent trips to telephones in Timmins, and<br/>what with the seven-foot snowdrifts along the way the fifteen-mile trek between the town and the<br/>drilling camp customarily took three and a half to four hours. One after another, new drill holes,<br/>begun at different places around the anomaly and pitched at different angles to it, were plunged into<br/>the earth. At first, only one drill rig could be used at a time because of a shortage of water, which was<br/>necessary to the operation; the ground was frozen solid and covered by deep snow, and water had to<br/>be laboriously pumped from under the ice on a pond about a half mile from Kidd-55. The third hole<br/>was finished on April 7th, and a fourth immediately begun with the same rig; the following day, the<br/>water shortage having eased somewhat, a fifth hole was inaugurated with a second drill rig, and two<br/>days after that—on the 10th—a third rig was pressed into service to drill still another hole. All in all,<br/>during the first days of April the principals in the affair were kept busy; in fact, during that period<br/>their buying of calls on Texas Gulf seems to have come to a standstill.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Bit by bit the drilling revealed the lineaments of a huge ore deposit; the third hole established that<br/>the original one had not gone “down dip” as had been feared, the fourth established that the mineral<br/>vein was a satisfactorily deep one, and so on. At some point—the exact point was to become a matter<br/>of dispute—Texas Gulf came to know that it had a workable mine of considerable proportions, and as<br/>this point approached, the focus of attention shifted from drillers and geologists to staff men and<br/>financiers, who were to be the principal object of the S.E.C.’s disapproval later on. At Timmins,<br/>snow fell so heavily on April 8th and most of the 9th that not even the geologists could get from the<br/>town to Kidd-55, but toward evening on the 9th, when they finally made it after a hair-raising journey<br/>of seven and a half hours, with them was no lesser light than Vice President Mollison, who had turned<br/>up in Timmins the previous day. Mollison spent the night at the drill site and left at about noon the<br/>next day—in order, he explained later, to avoid the outdoorsmen’s lunch they served at Kidd-55<br/>which was too hearty for a deskbound man like him. But before going he issued instructions for the<br/>drilling of a mill test hole, which would produce a relatively large core that could be used to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>determine the amenability of the mineral material to routine mill processing. Normally, a mill test<br/>hole is not drilled until a workable mine is believed to exist. And so it may have been in this case;<br/>two S.E.C. mining experts were to insist later, against contrary opinions of experts for the defense,<br/>that by the time Mollison gave his order, Texas Gulf had information on the basis of which it could<br/>have calculated that the ore reserves at Kidd-55 had a gross assay value of at least two hundred<br/>million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark133"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>famous Canadian mining grapevine was humming by now, and in retrospect the wonder is that it<br/>had been relatively quiet for so long. (A Toronto broker was to remark during the trial, “I have seen<br/>drillers drop the goddam drill and beat it for a brokerage office as fast as they can … [or else] they<br/>pick up the telephone and call Toronto.” After such a call, the broker went on, the status of every Bay<br/>Street penny-stock tout depends, for a time, on how close a personal acquaintance he can claim with<br/>the driller who made the strike, just as a racetrack tout’s status depends sometimes on the degree of<br/>intimacy he can claim with a jockey or a horse.) “The moccasin telegraph has Texas Gulf’s activity<br/>centered in Kidd Township. A battery of drills are reported to be at work,” said </span><i>The Northern</i><span>, a Toronto weekly of immense influence in the mining-stock set, on the 9th, and the same day<br/>the Toronto </span><i>Daily Star </i><span>declared that Timmins was “bug-eyed with excitement” and that “the magic<br/>word on every street corner and in every barber shop is ‘Texas Gulf.’” The phones in Texas Gulf’s<br/>New York headquarters were buzzing with frenzied queries, which the officers coldly turned aside.<br/>On the 10th, President Stephens was concerned enough about the rumors to seek counsel from one of<br/>his most trusted associates—Thomas S. Lamont, senior member of the Texas Gulf board of directors,<br/>former second-generation Morgan partner, holder of various lofty offices, past and present, in the<br/>Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, and bearer of a name that had long been one to conjure with in<br/>Wall Street. Stephens told Lamont what had been going on north of Timmins (it was the first Lamont<br/>had heard of it), made it clear that he himself did not yet feel that the evidence justified bug eyes, and<br/>asked what Lamont thought ought to be done about the exaggerated reports. As long as they stayed in<br/>the Canadian press, Lamont replied, “I think you might be able to live with them.” However, he<br/>added, if they should get into the papers in the United States, it might be well to give the press an<br/>announcement that would set the record straight and avoid undue gyrations in the stock market.</span><a name="bookmark134">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark135"><span>The following day, Saturday the 11th, the reports reached the United States papers with a bang. The<br/></span></a><i>Times </i>and <i>Herald Tribune </i><span>both ran accounts on the Texas Gulf discovery, and the latter, putting its<br/>story on the front page, spoke of “the biggest ore strike since gold was discovered more than sixty<br/>years ago in Canada.” After reading these stories, perhaps with eyes bugging slightly, Stephens<br/>notified Fogarty that a press release should be issued in time for Monday’s papers, and over the<br/>weekend Fogarty, with the help of several other company officials, worked one up. Meanwhile,<br/>things were not standing still at Kidd-55; on the contrary, later testimony held that on Saturday and<br/>Sunday, as more and more core came up from the drill holes full of copper and zinc ore, the<br/>calculable value of the mine was increasing almost hour by hour. However, Fogarty did not<br/>communicate with Timmins after Friday night, so the statement that he and his colleagues issued to the<br/>press on Sunday afternoon was not based on the most up-to-the-minute information. Whether because<br/>of that or for some other reason, the statement did not convey the idea that Texas Gulf thought it had a<br/>new Comstock Lode. Characterizing the published reports as exaggerated and unreliable, it admitted<br/>only that recent drilling on “one property near Timmins” had led to “preliminary indications that more<br/>drilling would be required for proper evaluation of the prospect;” went on to say that “the drilling<br/>done to date has not been conclusive;” and then, putting the same thought in what can hardly be called</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">another way, added that “the work done to date has not been sufficient to reach definite conclusions.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The idea thus couched, or perhaps one should say bedded down, evidently came across to the<br/>public when it appeared in Monday morning’s newspapers, because Texas Gulf stock was not nearly<br/>so buoyant early that week as it might have been expected to be if the enthusiastic </span><i>Times </i>and <i>Herald</i><span>stories had gone unchallenged. The stock, which had been selling at around 17 or 18 the<br/>previous November and had crept up over the intervening months to around 30, opened Monday on<br/>the New York Stock Exchange at 32—a rise of nearly two points over Friday’s closing—only to<br/>reverse direction and sink to 30⅞ before the day’s trading, was over, and to slip off still further on<br/>the following two days and at one point on Wednesday touch a low of 28⅞. Evidently, investors and<br/>traders had been considerably impressed by Texas Gulf’s Sunday mood of deprecation. But on those<br/>same three days, Texas Gulf people in both Canada and New York seem to have been in quite another<br/>mood. At Kidd-55 on Monday the 13th, the day the low-keyed press release was reported in<br/>newspapers, the mill test hole was completed, drills continued to grind away on three regular test<br/>holes, and a reporter for </span><i>The Northern Miner </i><span>was shown around and briefed on the findings by<br/>Mollison, Holyk, and Darke. The things they told the reporter make it clear, in retrospect, that<br/>whatever the drafters of the release may have believed on Sunday, the men at Kidd-55 knew on<br/>Monday that they had a mine and a big one. However, the world was not to know it, or at least not<br/>from that source, until Thursday morning, when the next issue of the </span><i>Miner </i><span>would appear in<br/>subscribers’ mail and on newsstands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark136"><span>Tuesday evening, Mollison and Holyk flew to Montreal, where they were planning to attend the<br/>annual convention of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, a gathering of several hundred<br/>leading mining and investment people. Upon arriving at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel where the<br/>convention was in progress, Mollison and Holyk were startled to find themselves greeted like film<br/>stars. The place had evidently been humming all day with rumors of a Texas Gulf discovery and<br/>everyone wanted to be the first to get the firsthand lowdown on it; in fact, a battery of television<br/>cameras had been set up for the express purpose of covering such remarks as the emissaries from<br/>Timmins might want to make. Not being authorized to make </span></a><i>any </i><span>remarks, Mollison and Holyk turned<br/>abruptly on their heels and fled the Queen Elizabeth, holing up for the night in a Montreal airport<br/>motel. The following day, Wednesday the 15th, they flew from Montreal to Toronto in the company,<br/>by prearrangement, of the Minister of Mines of the Province of Ontario and his deputy; en route they<br/>briefed the minister on the Kidd-55 situation, whereupon the minister declared that he wanted to clear<br/>the air by making a public announcement on the matter as soon as possible, and then, with Mollison’s<br/>help, he drafted such an announcement. According to a copy that Mollison made and kept, the<br/>announcement stated, in part, that “the information now in hand … gives the company confidence to<br/>allow       me to announce that Texas Gulf Sulphur has a mineable body of zinc, copper, and silver ore of<br/>substantial dimensions that will be developed and brought to production as soon as possible.”<br/>Mollison and Holyk were given to believe that the minister would make his statement in Toronto at<br/>eleven o’clock that evening, over radio and television, and that thus Texas Gulf’s good news would<br/>become public property a few hours before </span><i>The Northern Miner </i><span>appeared early the next day. But for<br/>reasons that have never been given, the minister didn’t make the announcement that evening.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At Texas Gulf headquarters, at 200 Park Avenue, there was a similar air of mounting crisis. The<br/>company happened to have a regular monthly board-of-directors meeting scheduled for Thursday<br/>morning, and on Monday Francis G. Coates, a director who lived in Houston, Texas, and who hadn’t<br/>heard of the Kidd-55 strike, telephoned Stephens to inquire whether he ought to bother to come.<br/>Stephens said he ought, but didn’t explain why. Better and better news kept filtering in from the drill</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark137"><span>site, and some time on Wednesday, the Texas Gulf officers decided that it was time to write a new<br/>press release, to be issued at a press conference that would follow the Thursday-morning directors’<br/>meeting. Stephens, Fogarty, and David M. Crawford, the company’s secretary, composed the release<br/>that afternoon. This time around, the release was based on the very latest information, and moreover,<br/>its language was happily devoid of both repetition and equivocation. It read, in part, “Texas Gulf<br/>Sulphur Company has made a major strike of zinc, copper, and silver in the Timmins area … Seven<br/>drill holes are now essentially complete and indicate an ore body of at least 800 feet in length, 300<br/>feet in width, and having a vertical depth of more than 800 feet. This is a major discovery. The<br/>preliminarydata indicate a reserve of more than 25 million tons of ore.” As to the striking difference<br/>between this release and the one of three days earlier, the new one stated that “considerably more<br/>data has been accumulated” in the interim. And no one could deny this; a reserve of more than twenty-<br/>five million tons of ore meant that the value of the ore was not the two hundred million dollars that<br/>was alleged to have been calculable a week earlier, but many times that much.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark138"><span>In the course of the same hectic day in New York, the engineer Clayton and the company secretary<br/>Crawford found time to call their brokers and order themselves some Texas Gulf stock—two hundred<br/>shares in Clayton’s case, three hundred in Crawford’s. And Crawford soon decided that he hadn’t<br/>plunged deeply enough; shortly after eight o’clock the next morning, after an apparently preoccupied<br/>night at the Park Lane Hotel, he awakened his broker with a second call and doubled his order.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s6">ON </span><span>Thursday morning, the first hard news of the Timmins strike spread through the North American<br/>investment world, rapidly but erratically. Between seven and eight o’clock, mailmen and newsstands<br/>in Toronto began distributing copies of </span><i>The Northern-Miner </i><span>containing the piece by the reporter who<br/>had visited Kidd55, in which he described the strike with a good deal of mining jargon but did not<br/>omit to call it, in language comprehensible enough for anyone, “a brilliant exploration success” and<br/>“a major new zinc-copper-silver mine.” At about the same time, the </span><i>Miner </i><span>was on its way out to<br/>subscribers south of the border in Detroit and Buffalo, and a few hundred newsstand copies appear to<br/>have arrived in New York between nine and ten o’clock. The paper’s physical appearance here,<br/>however, was preceded by telephone reports on its contents from Toronto, and by about 9:15 the<br/>news that Texas Gulf had hit it big for sure was the talk of New York brokerage offices. A customer’s<br/>man in the Sixtieth Street office of E. F. Hutton &amp; Company complained later that his broker cronies<br/>had been so eager to natter on the telephone about Texas Gulf early that morning as to substantially<br/>prevent him from communicating with his customers; however, he did manage to squeeze in a call to<br/>two of them, a husband and wife for whom he was able to turn a rather quick profit in Texas Gulf—to<br/>be exact, a profit of $10,500 in less than an hour. (“It is clear that we are all in the wrong business,”<br/>Judge Bonsal was to comment when he heard this. Or as the late Wieland Wagner once remarked in<br/>another context, “I shall be quite explicit. Valhalla is Wall Street.”) At the Stock Exchange itself early<br/>that day, the traders in the Luncheon Club, which before the ten-o’clock opening serves as a breakfast<br/>club, were all munching on the Texas Gulf situation along with their toast and eggs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark139"><span>At the directors’ meeting at 200 Park, which began promptly at nine, the directors were shown the<br/>new statement that was shortly to be released to the press, and Stephens, Fogarty, Holyk, and<br/>Mollison, as representatives of the exploration group, commented in turn on the Timmins discovery.<br/>Stephens also stated that the Ontario Minister of Mines had announced it publicly in Toronto the<br/>previous evening (a misstatement, of course, although an unintentional one; actually, the minister was<br/>making his announcement to the Ontario Parliament press gallery in Toronto at almost the same<br/>moment Stephens was speaking). The directors’ meeting ended at about ten o’clock, whereupon a</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>clutch of reporters—twenty-two of them, representing many of the major United States newspapers<br/>and magazines, general and financial—trooped into the board room for the press conference, the<br/>Texas Gulf directors all remaining in their places. Stephens distributed copies of the press release to<br/>the reporters and then, in fulfillment of a curious ritual that governs such affairs, read it aloud. While<br/>he was engaged in this redundant recital various reporters began to drift away (“they began sort of<br/>leaking out of the room” was the way Lamont put it later) to telephone the sensational news to their<br/>publications; still more of them slipped away during the events that subsequently rounded out the<br/>press conference—the showing of some innocuous colored slides of the countryside around Timmins,<br/>and an exhibition and explanation by Holyk of some drill cores—and by the time it ended, at around<br/>10:15, only a handful of reporters were left. This certainly didn’t mean that the affair had been a flop.<br/>On the contrary, a press conference is perhaps the only kind of show whose success is in direct<br/>proportion to the number of people who leave before it is over.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark140"><span>The actions of two of the Texas Gulf directors, Coates and Lamont, during the next half hour or so<br/>were to give rise to the most controversial part of the S.E.C.’s complaint, and, since the controversy<br/>has now been inscribed in the law, those actions are likely to be studied for at least a generation by<br/>inside stock traders seeking guidance as to what they must do to be saved, or at least to avoid being<br/>damned. The essence of the controversy was timing, and in particular, the timing of Coates’ and<br/>Lamont’s maneuvers in relation to that of the dissemination of the Texas Gulf news by the Dow Jones<br/>News Service, the familiar spot-news facility for investors. Few investment offices in the United<br/>States are without the service, and its prestige is such that in some investment circles the moment a<br/>piece of news becomes public is considered to be determined by the moment it crosses the broad<br/>tape. As to the morning of April 16th, 1964, a Dow Jones reporter was not only among those at the<br/>Texas Gulf press conference but was among those who left early to telephone the news to his office.<br/>According to his recollection, the reporter made his call between 10:10 and 10:15, and normally an<br/>item of such importance as the one he sent would begin to be printed out by Dow Jones machines in<br/>offices from coast to coast within two or three minutes after being telephoned in. In fact, though, the<br/>Texas Gulf story did not begin to appear until 10:54, an entirely inexplicable forty-odd minutes later.<br/>The mystery of the broad tape message, like the mystery of the Minister of Mines’ announcement, was<br/>left unraveled in the trial on grounds of irrelevance; an engaging aspect of the rules of evidence is<br/>their tendency to leave a few things to the imagination.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Coates, the Texan, was the first director to embark upon what he can hardly have thought of at the<br/>time as a historically significant course. Either before or immediately after the end of the press<br/>conference he went into an office adjoining the board room, where he borrowed a telephone and<br/>called his son-in-law, H. Fred Haemisegger, who is a stockbroker in Houston. Coates, as he related<br/>later, told Haemisegger of the Texas Gulf discovery and added that he had waited to call until “after<br/>the public announcement” because he was “too old to get into trouble with the S.E.C.” He then placed<br/>an order for two thousand shares of Texas Gulf stock for four family trusts of which he was a trustee,<br/>though not personally a beneficiary. The stock, which had opened on the Stock Exchange some twenty<br/>minutes earlier at a fraction above 30 in very active but by no means decisively bullish trading, was<br/>now rapidly on its way up, but by acting quickly Haemisegger managed to buy the block for Coates at<br/>between 31 and 31⅝, getting his orders in to his firm’s floor broker well before the unaccountably<br/>delayed news began to come out on the broad tape.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark141"><span>Lamont, in the Wall Street tradition of plungers rather than the Texas one, made his move with<br/>decision but with an elegant, almost languorous lack of hurry. Instead of leaving the board room at the<br/>conclusion of the press conference, he stayed there for some twenty minutes, not doing much of</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark142"><span>anything. “I milled around … and listened to some of them chatter and talk with each other, and<br/>slapped people on the back,” he recounted later. Then, at 10:39 or 10:40, he went to a nearby office<br/>and telephoned a colleague and friend of his at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company—Longstreet<br/>Hinton, the bank’s executive vice president and the head of its trust department. Earlier in the week<br/>Hinton had asked Lamont if he, as a Texas Gulf director, could shed any light on the rumors of an ore<br/>discovery that were appearing in the press, and Lamont had replied that he couldn’t. Now Lamont, as<br/>he recalled later, told Hinton “that there was news which had come out, or was shortly coming out, on<br/>the ticker, which would be of interest to him, regarding Texas Gulf Sulphur.” “Is it good?” Hinton<br/>asked, and Lamont replied that it was “pretty good” or “very good.” (Neither man is sure which he<br/>said, but it doesn’t matter, since in New York bankerese “pretty good” </span></a><i>means </i><span>“very good.”) In any<br/>case, Hinton did not follow the advice to look at the Dow Jones ticker, even though a machine was<br/>ticking twenty feet from his office; instead, he immediately called the bank’s trading department and<br/>asked for a market quotation on Texas Gulf. After getting it, he placed an order to buy 3,000 shares<br/>for the account of the Nassau Hospital, of which he was treasurer. All this occupied no more than two<br/>minutes from the time Lamont had left the press conference. The order had been transmitted from the<br/>bank to the Stock Exchange and executed, and Nassau Hospital had its stock, before Hinton would<br/>have seen anything about Texas Gulf on the broad tape if he had been looking at it. But he was not<br/>looking at it; he was otherwise occupied. After placing the Nassau Hospital order, he went to the<br/>office of the Morgan Guaranty officer in charge of pension trusts and suggested that </span><i>he </i><span>buy some<br/>Texas Gulf for the trusts. In a matter of less than a half an hour, the bank had ordered 7,000 shares for<br/>its pension fund and profit-sharing account—two thousand of them before the announcement had<br/>begun to appear on the broad tape, and the rest either while it was appearing or within a few minutes<br/>afterward. A bit more than an hour after that—at 12:33 p.m.—Lamont bought 3,000 shares for himself<br/>and members of his family, this time having to pay 34½ for them, since Texas Gulf by that time was<br/>on its way up for fair. As it was to continue to be for days, months, and years. It closed that afternoon<br/>at 36⅜, it reached a high of 58⅜ later that month, and by the end of 1966, when commercial<br/>production of ore was at last under way at Kidd-55 and the enormous new mine was expected to<br/>account for one-tenth of Canada’s total annual production of copper and one-quarter of its total annual<br/>production of zinc, the stock was selling at over 100. Anyone who had bought Texas Gulf between<br/>November 12th, 1963 and the morning (or even the lunch hour) of April 16th, 1964 had therefore at<br/>least tripled his money.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PERHAPS <span class="p">the most arresting aspect of the Texas Gulf trial—apart from the fact that a trial was taking<br/>place at all—was the vividness and variety of the defendants who came before Judge Bonsal, ranging<br/>as they did from a hot-eyed mining prospector like Clayton (a genuine Welchman with a degree in<br/>mining from the University of Cardiff) through vigorous and harried corporate nabobs like Fogarty<br/>and Stephens to a Texas wheeler-dealer like Coates and a polished Brahmin of finance like Lamont.<br/>(Darke, who had left Texas Gulf’s employ soon after April, 1964 to become a private investor—<br/>which may or may not indicate that he had become a man of independent means—declined to appear<br/>at the trial on the ground that his Canadian nationality put him beyond the reach of subpoena by a<br/>United States court, and the S.E.C. grieved loudly over this refusal; defense counsel, however,<br/>scornfully insisted that the S.E.C. was really delighted to have Darke absent, thus allowing plaintiff to<br/>paint him as Mephistopheles hiding in the wings.) The S.E.C, after its counsel, Frank E. Kennamer<br/>Jr., had announced his intention to “drag to light and pillory the misconduct of these defendants,”<br/>asked the court to issue a permanent injunction forbidding Fogarty, Mollison, Clayton, Holyk, Darke,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Crawford, and several other corporate insiders who had bought stock or calls between November<br/>8th, 1963 and April 15th, 1964, from ever again “engaging in any act … which operates or would<br/>operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with purchase or sale of securities”;<br/>further—and here it was breaking entirely new ground—it prayed that the Court order the defendants<br/>to make restitution to the persons they had allegedly defrauded by buying stock or calls from them on<br/>the basis of inside information. The S.E.C. also charged that the pessimistic April 12th press release<br/>was deliberately deceptive, and asked that because of it Texas Gulf be enjoined from “making any<br/>untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact.” Apart from any question of loss<br/>of corporate face, the nub of the matter here lay in the fact that such a judgment, if granted, might well<br/>open the way for legal action against the company by </span><i>any </i><span>stockholder who had sold his Texas Gulf<br/>stock to </span><i>anybody </i><span>in the interim between the first press release and the second one, and since the<br/>shares that had changed hands during that period had run into the millions, it was a nub indeed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Apart from legal technicalities, counsel based its defense of the early insider stock purchases<br/>chiefly on the argument that the information yielded by the first drill hole in November had made the<br/>prospect of a workable mine not a sure thing but only a sporting proposition, and to buttress this<br/>argument, it paraded before the judge a platoon of mining experts who testified as to the notorious<br/>fickleness of first drill holes, some of the witnesses going so far as to say that the hole might very<br/>well have turned out to be not an asset but a liability to Texas Gulf. The people who had bought stock<br/>or calls during the winter insisted that the drill hole had had little or nothing to do with their decision</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark143"><span>—they had been motivated simply by the feeling that Texas Gulf was a good investment at that<br/>juncture on general principles; and Clayton attributed his abrupt appearance as a substantial investor<br/>to the fact that he had just married a well-to-do wife. The S.E.C. countered with its own parade of<br/>experts, maintaining that the nature of the first core had been such as to make the existence of a rich<br/>mine an overwhelming probability, and that therefore those privy to the facts about it had possessed a<br/>material fact. As the S.E.C. put it saltily in a post-trial brief, “the argument that the defendants were<br/>free to purchase the stock until the existence of a mine had been established beyond doubt is<br/>equivalent to saying that there is no unfairness in betting on a horse entered in a race, knowing that the<br/>animal has received an illegal stimulant, because in the homestretch the horse might drop dead.”<br/>Defense counsel declined to be drawn into argument on the equine analogy. As to the pessimistic<br/>April 12th release, the S.E.C. made much of the fact that Fogarty, its chief drafter, had based it on<br/>information that was almost forty-eight hours old when it was issued, despite the fact that<br/>communications between Kidd-55, Timmins, and New York were relatively good at the time, and<br/>expressed the view that “the most indulgent explanation for his strange conduct is that Dr. Fogarty<br/>simply did not care whether he gave the shareholders of Texas Gulf and the public a discouraging<br/>statement based on stale information.” Brushing aside the question of staleness, the defense asserted<br/>that the release “accurately stated the status of the drilling in the opinion of Stephens, Fogarty,<br/>Mollison, Holyk, and Clayton,” that “the problem presented was obviously one of judgment,” and that<br/>the company had been in a particularly difficult and sensitive position in that if it had, instead, issued<br/>an overly optimistic report that had later proved to have been based on false hopes, it could just as<br/>well have then been accused of fraud for that.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Weighing the crucial question of whether the information obtained from the first drill hole had been<br/>“material,” Judge Bonsal concluded that the definition of materiality in such instances must be a<br/>conservative one. There was, he pointed out, a question of public policy involved: “It is important<br/>under our free-enterprise system that insiders, including directors, officers, and employees, be<br/>encouraged to own securities of their company. The incentive that comes with stock ownership</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark144"><span>benefits both the company and the stockholders.” Keeping his definition conservative, he decided that<br/>up until the evening of April 9th, when three converging drill holes positively established the three-<br/>dimensionality of the ore deposit, material information had not been in hand, and the decisions of the<br/>insiders to buy Texas Gulf stock before that date, even if based on the drilling results, were no more<br/>than perfectly sporting, and legal, “educated guesses.” (A newspaper columnist who disagreed with<br/>the judge’s finding was to remark that the guesses had been so educated as to qualify for </span></a><i>summa cum</i><span>.) In the case of Darke, the judge found that the spate of stock purchases by his tippees and sub-<br/>tippees on the last days of March seemed highly likely to have been instigated by word from Darke<br/>that drilling at Kidd-55 was about to be resumed; but even here, according to Judge Bonsal’s logic,<br/>material information did not yet exist and therefore could neither be acted upon nor passed along to<br/>others.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Case was therefore dismissed against all educated guessers who had bought stock or calls, or made<br/>recommendations to tippees, before the evening of April 9th. With Clayton and Crawford, who had<br/>been so injudicious as to buy or order stock on April 15th, it was another matter. The judge found no<br/>evidence that they had intended to deceive or defraud anyone, but they </span><i>had </i><span>made their purchases with<br/>the full knowledge that a great mine had been found and that it would be announced the next day—in<br/>short, with material private information in hand. Therefore they were found to have violated Rule<br/>10B-5, and in due time would presumably be enjoined from doing such a thing again and made to<br/>offer restitution to the persons they bought their April 15th shares from—assuming, of course, that<br/>such persons can be found, the complexities of stock-exchange trading being such that it isn’t always<br/>an easy matter to figure out exactly whom one has been dealing with on any particular transaction.<br/>The law in our time is, and probably ought to remain, almost unrealistically humanistic; in its eyes,<br/>corporations are people, stock exchanges are street-corner marketplaces where buyer and seller<br/>haggle face to face, and computers scarcely exist.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark145"><span>As for the April 12th press release, the judge found it in retrospect “gloomy” and “incomplete,” but<br/>he acknowledged that its purpose had been the worthy one of correcting the exaggerated rumors that<br/>had been appearing and decided that the S.E.C. had failed to prove that it was false, misleading, or<br/>deceptive. Thus he dismissed the complaint that Texas Gulf had deliberately tried to confuse its<br/>stockholders and the public.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UP <span class="p">to this point, it was two wins against a whole string of losses for the S.E.C., and the right of a<br/>miner to drop his drill and run for a brokerage office appeared to have retained most of its sanctity,<br/>provided at least that his drill hole is the first of a series. But there remained to be settled the matter<br/>that, of all those contested in the case, was of the most consequence to stockholders, stock traders,<br/>and the national economy, as opposed to the members of corporate mining exploration groups. It was<br/>the matter of the April 16th activities of Coates and Lamont, and its importance lay in the fact that it<br/>turned on the question of precisely when, in the eyes of the law, a piece of information ceases to be<br/>inside and becomes public. The question had never before been subjected to anything like so exacting<br/>a test, so what came out of the Texas Gulf case would instantly become the legal authority on the<br/>subject until superseded by some even more refined case.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The basic position of the S.E.C. was that the stock purchases of Coates, and the circumspect tip<br/>given by Lamont to Hinton by telephone, were illegal use of inside information because they were<br/>accomplished before the announcement of the ore strike on the Dow Jones broad tape—an<br/>announcement that the S.E.C.’s lawyers kept referring to as the “official” one, although the Dow Jones<br/>service, much as it might like to, derives no such status from any authority other than custom. But the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark146"><span>S.E.C. went further than that. Even if the two directors’ telephone calls had been made after the<br/>“official” announcement, it contended, they would have been improper and illegal unless enough time<br/>had elapsed for the news to be thoroughly absorbed by members of the investing public not privileged<br/>to attend the press conference or even to be watching the broad tape at the right moment. Defense<br/>counsel saw things rather differently. In its view, far from being culpable regardless of whether or not<br/>they had acted before or after the broad tape announcement, its clients were innocent in either case. In<br/>the first place, the lawyers contended, Coates and Lamont had every reason to believe the news was<br/>out, since Stephens had said during the directors’ meeting that it had been released by the Ontario<br/>Minister of Mines the previous evening, and therefore Coates and Lamont acted in good faith; in the<br/>second place, counsel went on, what with the buzzing in brokerage offices and the early-morning<br/>excitement at the Stock Exchange, to all intents and purposes the news really </span></a><i>was </i><span>out, via osmosis and<br/></span><i>The Northern Miner</i><span>, considerably before it appeared on the ticker or before the mooted telephone<br/>calls were made. Lamont’s lawyers argued that their client hadn’t advised Hinton to buy Texas Gulf<br/>stock, anyhow; he’d merely advised him to look at the broad tape, an act as innocent to recommend as<br/>to perform, and what Hinton had done then had been entirely on his own hook. In sum, the lawyers for<br/>the two sides could agree on neither whether the rules had been violated nor what the rules actually<br/>were; indeed, it was one of the defense’s contentions that the S.E.C. was asking the court to write<br/>new rules and then apply them retroactively, while the plaintiff insisted that he was merely asking that<br/>an old rule, 10B-5, be applied broadly, in the spirit of the Marquis of Queensberry. Near the end of<br/>the trial Lamont’s lawyers, bearing down hard, created a courtroom sensation by introducing a<br/>surprise exhibit, a large, elaborate map of the United States dotted with colored flags, some blue,<br/>some red, some green, some gold, some silver—each flag, the lawyers announced, denoting a place<br/>where the Texas Gulf news had been disseminated before Lamont had acted or it had reached the<br/>broad tape. On questioning, it came out that all but eight of the flags represented offices of the<br/>brokerage firm of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, on whose interoffice wire the news had<br/>been carried at 10:29; but while this revelation of the highly limited scope of the dissemination may<br/>have mitigated the legal force of the map, it apparently did not mitigate the esthetic impression on the<br/>judge. “Isn’t that beautiful?” he exclaimed, while the S.E.C. men fumed in chagrin, and when one of<br/>the proud defense lawyers noticed a couple of locations on the map that had been overlooked and<br/>pointed out that there should really be even more flags, Judge Bonsal, still bemused, shook his head<br/>and said he was afraid that wouldn’t work, since all known colors seemed to have been used already.<br/>Lamont’s fastidiousness in waiting until 12:33, almost two hours after his call to Hinton, before he<br/>bought stock for himself and his family left the S.E.C. unimpressed—and it was here that the<br/>Commission took its most avant-garde stand and asked the judge for a decision that would forge most<br/>fearlessly into the legal jungles of the future. As the stand was set forth in the S.E.C. briefs, “It is the<br/>Commission’s position that even after corporate information has been published in the news media,<br/>insiders, are still under a duty to refrain from securities transactions until there had elapsed a<br/>reasonable amount of time in which the securities industry, the shareholders, and the investing public<br/>can evaluate the development and make informed investment decisions … Insiders must wait at least<br/>until the information is likely to have reached the average investor who follows the market and he has<br/>had some opportunity to consider it.” In the Texas Gulf case, the S.E.C. argued, one hour and thirty-<br/>nine minutes after the start of the broad-tape transmission was not long enough for that evaluation, as<br/>evidenced by the fact that the enormous rise in the price of Texas Gulf stock had hardly more than<br/>started by that time, and therefore Lamont’s 12:33 purchases had violated the Securities Exchange<br/>Act. What, then, did the S.E.C. think </span><i>would </i>be “a reasonable amount of time”? That would “vary from<a name="bookmark147">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>case to case,” the S.E.C.’s counsel Kennamer said in his summation, according to the nature of the<br/>inside information; for example, word of a dividend cut would probably percolate through the dullest<br/>investor’s brain in a very short time, while a piece of news as unusual and abstruse as Texas Gulf’s<br/>might take days, or even longer. It would, Kennamer said, be “a nearly impossible task to formulate a<br/>rigid set of rules that would apply in all situations of this sort.” Therefore, in the S.E.C.’s canon, the<br/>only way an insider could find out whether he had waited long enough before buying his company’s<br/>stock was by being haled into court and seeing what the judge would decide.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark148"><span>Lamont’s counsel, led by S. Hazard Gillespie, went after this stand with the same zeal, if not<br/>actually glee, that had marked its foray into cartography. First, Gillespie said, the S.E.C. had<br/>contended that Coates’ call to Haemisegger and Lamont’s to Hinton had been wrong because they had<br/>been made before the broadtape announcement; then it had said that Lamont’s later stock purchase had<br/>been wrong because it had been made </span></a><i>after </i><span>the announcement, but not long enough after. If these<br/>apparently opposite courses of action were both fraud, what was right conduct? The S.E.C. seemed to<br/>want to have the rules made up as it went along—or, rather, to have the courts make them up. As<br/>Gillespie put the matter more formally, the S.E.C. was “asking the court to write … a rule judicially<br/>and to apply it retroactively to adjudicate Mr. Lamont guilty of fraud because of conduct which he<br/>reasonably believed to be entirely proper.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It wouldn’t stand up, Judge Bonsal agreed—and for that matter, neither would the S.E.C.’s<br/>contention that the time of the broad-tape transmission had been the time when the news had become<br/>public. He took the narrower view that, based on legal precedent, the controlling moment had been<br/>the one when the press release had been read and handed to the reporters, even though hardly any<br/>outsider—that is, hardly anybody at all—had known of it for some time afterward. Clearly troubled<br/>by the implications of this finding, Judge Bonsal added that “it may be, as the Commission contends,<br/>that a more effective rule should be established to preclude insiders from acting on information after<br/>it has been announced but before it has been absorbed by the public.” But he didn’t think it was up to<br/>him to write such a rule. Nor did he think it was up to him to determine whether or not Lamont had<br/>waited long enough before placing his 12:33 order. If it were left to judges to make such<br/>determinations, he said, “this could only lead to uncertainty. A decision in one case would not control<br/>another case with different facts. No insider would know whether he had waited long enough … If a<br/>waiting period is to be fixed, this could be most appropriately done by the Commission.” No one<br/>would bell the cat, and the complaints against Coates and Lamont were dismissed.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark149">THE </a><span class="p">S.E.C. appealed all the dismissals, and Clayton and Crawford, the only two defendants found to<br/>have violated the Securities Exchange Act, appealed the judgments against them. In its appeal brief<br/>the Commission painstakingly reviewed the evidence and suggested to the Circuit Court that Judge<br/>Bonsal had erred in his interpretation of it, while the defense brief for Clayton and Crawford<br/>concentrated on the possibly detrimental effects of the doctrine implied in the finding against them.<br/>Might not the doctrine mean, for example, that every security analyst who does his best to ferret out<br/>little-known facts about a particular company, and then recommends that company’s stock to his<br/>customers as he is paid to do, could be adjudged an insider improperly distributing tips precisely<br/>because of his diligence? Might it not tend to “stifle investment by corporate personnel and impede<br/>the flow of corporate information to investors”?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Perhaps so. At all events, in August, 1968, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit handed<br/>down a decision which flatly reversed Judge Bonsal’s findings on just about every score except the<br/>findings against Crawford and Clayton, which were affirmed. The Appeals Court found that the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">original November drill hole <i>had </i><span>provided material evidence of a valuable ore deposit, and that<br/>therefore Fogarty, Mollison, Darke, Holyk, and all other insiders who had bought Texas Gulf stock or<br/>calls on it during the winter were guilty of violations of the law; that the gloomy April 12th press<br/>release had been ambiguous and perhaps misleading; and that Coates had improperly and illegally<br/>jumped the gun in placing his orders right after the April 16th press conference. Only Lamont—the<br/>charges against whom had been dropped following his death shortly after the lower court decision—<br/>and a Texas Gulf office manager, John Murray, remained exonerated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The decision was a famous victory for the S.E.C., and the first reaction of Wall Street was to cry<br/>out that it would make for utter confusion. Pending further appeals to the Supreme Court, it would, at<br/>least, result in an interesting experiment.

B. Dick Company, of Chicago, in 1887, it<br/>did not take the country by storm. On the contrary, Mr. Dick—a former lumberman who had become<br/>bored with copying his price lists by hand, had tried to invent a duplicating machine himself, and had<br/>finally obtained rights to produce the mimeograph from its inventor, Thomas Alva Edison—found<br/>himself faced with a formidable marketing problem. “People didn’t </span><i>want </i><span>to make lots of copies of<br/>office documents,” says his grandson C. Matthews Dick, Jr., currently a vice-president of the A. B.<br/>Dick Company, which now manufactures a whole line of office copiers and duplicators, including<br/>mimeograph machines. “By and large, the first users of the thing were non-business organizations like<br/>churches, schools, and Boy Scout troops. To attract companies and professional men, Grandfather and<br/>his associates had to undertake an enormous missionary effort. Office duplicating by machine was a<br/>new and unsettling idea that upset long-established office patterns. In 1887, after all, the typewriter<br/>had been on the market only a little over a decade and wasn’t yet in widespread use, and neither was<br/>carbon paper. If a businessman or a lawyer wanted five copies of a document, he’d have a clerk make<br/>five copies—by hand. People would say to Grandfather, ‘Why should I want to have a lot of copies<br/>of this and that lying around? Nothing but clutter in the office, a temptation to prying eyes, and a waste<br/>of good paper.’”</span><a name="bookmark154">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark155"><span>On another level, the troubles that the elder Mr. Dick encountered were perhaps connected with the<br/>generally bad repute that the notion of making copies of graphic material had been held in for a<br/>number of centuries—a bad repute reflected in the various overtones of the English noun and verb<br/>“copy.” The Oxford English Dictionary makes it clear that during those centuries there was an aura of<br/>deceit associated with the word; indeed, from the late sixteenth century until Victorian times “copy”<br/>and “counterfeit” were nearly synonymous. (By the middle of the seventeenth century, the medieval<br/>use of the noun “copy” in the robust sense of “plenty” or “abundance” had faded out, leaving behind<br/>nothing but its adjective form, “copious.”) “The only good copies are those which exhibit the defects<br/>of bad originals,” La Rochefoucauld wrote in his “Maxims” in 1665. “Never buy a copy of a<br/>picture,” Ruskin pronounced dogmatically in 1857, warning not against chicanery but against<br/>debasement. And the copying of written documents was often suspect, too. “Though the attested Copy<br/>of a Record be good proof, yet the Copy of a Copy never so well attested … will not be admitted as<br/>proof in Judicature,” John Locke wrote in 1690. At about the same time, the printing trade contributed<br/>to the language the suggestive expression “foul copy,” and it was a favorite Victorian habit to call one<br/>object, or person, a pale copy of another.</span></a><a name="bookmark156">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Practical necessity arising out of increasing industrialization was doubtless chiefly responsible for<br/>a twentieth-century reversal of these attitudes. In any case, office reproduction began to grow very</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark157"><span>rapidly. (It may seem paradoxical that this growth coincided with the rise of the telephone, but<br/>perhaps it isn’t. All the evidence suggests that communication between people by whatever means, far<br/>from simply accomplishing its purpose, invariably breeds the need for more.) The typewriter and<br/>carbon paper came into common use after 1890, and mimeographing became a standard office<br/>procedure soon after 1900. “No office is complete without an Edison Mimeograph,” the Dick<br/>Company felt able to boast in 1903. By that time, there were already about a hundred and fifty<br/>thousand of the devices in use; by 1910 there were probably over two hundred thousand, and by 1940<br/>almost half a million. The offset printing press—a mettlesome competitor capable of producing work<br/>much handsomer than mimeographed output—was successfully adapted for office use in the nineteen-<br/>thirties and forties, and is now standard equipment in most large offices. As with the mimeograph<br/>machine, though, a special master page must be prepared before reproduction can start—a relatively<br/>expensive and time-consuming process—so the offset press is economically useful only when a<br/>substantial number of copies are wanted. In office-equipment jargon, the offset press and the<br/>mimeograph are “duplicators” rather than “copiers,” the dividing line between duplicating and<br/>copying being generally drawn somewhere between ten and twenty copies. Where technology lagged<br/>longest was in the development of efficient and economical copiers. Various photographic devices<br/>that did not require the making of master pages—of which the most famous was (and still is) the<br/>Photostat—began appearing around 1910, but because of their high cost, slowness, and difficulty of<br/>operation, their usefulness was largely limited to the copying of architectural and engineering<br/>drawings and legal documents. Until after 1950, the only practical machine for making a copy of a<br/>business letter or a page of typescript was a typewriter with carbon paper in its platen.</span></a><a name="bookmark158">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark159"><span>The nineteen-fifties were the raw, pioneering years of mechanized office copying. Within a short<br/>time, there suddenly appeared on the market a whole batch of devices capable of reproducing most<br/>office papers without the use of a master page, at a cost of only a few cents per copy, and within a<br/>time span of a minute or less per copy. Their technology varied—Minnesota Mining &amp;<br/>Manufacturing’s Thermo-Fax, introduced in 1950, used heat-sensitive copying paper; American<br/>Photocopy’s Dial-A-Matic Autostat (1952) was based on a refinement of ordinary photography;<br/>Eastman Kodak’s Verifax (1953) used a method called dye transfer; and so on—but almost all of<br/>them, unlike Mr. Dick’s mimeograph, immediately found a ready market, partly because they filled a<br/>genuine need and partly, it now seems clear, because they and their function exercised a powerful<br/>psychological fascination on their users. In a society that sociologists are forever characterizing as<br/>“mass,” the notion of  making one-of-a-kind things into many-of-a-kind things showed signs of<br/>becoming a real compulsion. However, all these pioneer copying machines had serious and<br/>frustrating inherent defects; for example, Autostat and Verifax were hard to operate and turned out<br/>damp copies that had to be dried, while Thermo-Fax copies tended to darken when exposed to too<br/>much heat, and all three could make copies only on special treated paper supplied by the<br/>manufacturer. What was needed for the compulsion to flower into a mania was a technological<br/>breakthrough, and the breakthrough came at the turn of the decade with the advent of a machine that<br/>worked on a new principle, known as xerography, and was able to make dry, good-quality, permanent<br/>copies on ordinary paper with a minimum of trouble. The effect was immediate. Largely as a result of<br/>xerography, the estimated number of copies (as opposed to duplicates) made annually in the United<br/>States sprang from some twenty million in the mid-fifties to nine and a half </span></a><i>billion </i><span>in 1964, and to<br/>fourteen billion in 1966—not to mention billions more in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. More<br/>than that, the attitude of educators toward printed textbooks and of business people toward written<br/>communicationunderwent a discernible change; avant-garde philosophers took to hailing xerography</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>as a revolution comparable in importance to the invention of the wheel; and coin-operated copying<br/>machines began turning up in candy stores and beauty parlors. The mania—not as immediately<br/>disrupting as the tulip mania in seventeenth-century Holland but probably destined to be considerably<br/>farther-reaching—was in full swing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark160"><span>The company responsible for the great breakthrough and the one on whose machines the majority of<br/>these billions of copies were made was, of course, the Xerox Corporation, of Rochester, New York.<br/>As a result, it became the most spectacular big-business success of the nineteen-sixties. In 1959, the<br/>year the company—then called Haloid Xerox, Inc.—introduced its first automatic xerographic office<br/>copier, its sales were thirty-three million dollars. In 1961, they were sixty-six million, in 1963 a<br/>hundred and seventy-six million, and in 1966 over half a billion. As Joseph C. Wilson, the chief<br/>executive of the firm, pointed out, this growth rate was such that if maintained for a couple of decades<br/>(which, perhaps fortunately for everyone, couldn’t possibly happen), Xerox sales would be larger<br/>than the gross national product of the United States. Unplaced in </span></a><i>Fortune’s </i><span>ranking of the five<br/>hundred largest American industrial companies in 1961, Xerox by 1964 had attained two-hundred-<br/>and-twenty-seventh place, and by 1967 it had climbed to hundred-and-twenty-sixth. </span><i>Fortune’s</i><span>ranking is based on annual sales; according to certain other criteria, Xerox placed much higher than<br/>hundred-and-seventy-first. For example, early in 1966 it ranked about sixty-third in the country in net<br/>profits, probably ninth in ratio of profit to sales, and about fifteenth in terms of the market value of its<br/>stock—and in this last respect the young upstart was ahead of such long-established industrial giants<br/>as U.S. Steel, Chrysler, Procter &amp; Gamble, and R.C.A. Indeed, the enthusiasm the investing public<br/>showed for Xerox made its shares the stock market Golconda of the sixties. Anyone who bought its<br/>stock toward the end of 1959 and held on to it until early 1967 would have found his holding worth<br/>about sixty-six times its original price, and anyone who was really fore-sighted and bought Haloid in<br/>1955 would have seen his original investment grow—one might almost say miraculously—a hundred<br/>and eighty times. Not surprisingly, a covey of “Xerox millionaires” sprang up—several hundred of<br/>them all told, most of whom either lived in the Rochester area or had come from there.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>The Haloid Company, started in Rochester in 1906, was the grandfather of Xerox, just as one of its<br/>founders—Joseph C. Wilson, a sometime pawnbroker and sometime mayor of Rochester—was the<br/>grandfather of his namesake, the 1946–1968 boss of Xerox. Haloid manufactured photographic<br/>papers, and, like all photographic companies—and especially those in Rochester—it lived in the<br/>giant shadow of its neighbor, Eastman Kodak. Even in this subdued light, though, it was effective<br/>enough to weather the Depression in modestly good shape. In the years immediately after the Second<br/>World War, however, both competition and labor costs increased, sending Haloid on a search for<br/>new products. One of the possibilities its scientists hit upon was a copying process that was being<br/>worked on at the Battelle Memorial Institute, a large non-profit industrial-research organization in<br/>Columbus, Ohio. At this point, the story flashes back to 1938 and a second-floor kitchen above a bar<br/>in Astoria, Queens, which was being used as a makeshift laboratory by an obscure thirty-two-year-<br/>old inventor named Chester F. Carlson. The son of a barber of Swedish extraction, and a graduate in<br/>physics of the California Institute of Technology, Carlson was employed in New York in the patent<br/>department of P. R. Mallory &amp; Co., an Indianapolis manufacturer of electrical and electronic<br/>components; in quest of fame, fortune, and independence, he was devoting his spare time to trying to<br/>invent an office copying machine, and to help him in this endeavor he had hired Otto Kornei, a<br/>German refugee physicist. The fruit of the two men’s experiments was a process by which, on<br/>October 22, 1938, after using a good deal of clumsy equipment and producing considerable smoke<br/>and stench, they were able to transfer from one piece of paper to another the unheroic message “10–</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark161"><span>22–38 Astoria.” The process, which Carlson called electrophotography, had—and has—five basic<br/>steps: sensitizing a photoconductive surface to light by giving it an electrostatic charge (for example,<br/>by rubbing it with fur); exposing this surface to a written page to form an electrostatic image;<br/>developing the latent image by dusting the surface with a powder that will adhere only to the charged<br/>areas; transferring the image to some sort of paper; and fixing the image by the application of heat.<br/>The steps, each of them in itself familiar enough in connection with other technologies, were utterly<br/>new in combination—so new, in fact, that the kings and captains of commerce were markedly slow to<br/>recognize the potentialities of the process. Applying the knowledge he had picked up in his job<br/>downtown, Carlson immediately wove a complicated net of patents around the invention (Kornei<br/>shortly left to take a job elsewhere, and thus vanished permanently from the electrophotographic<br/>scene) and set about trying to peddle it. Over the next five years, while continuing to work for<br/>Mallory, he pursued his moonlighting in a new form, offering rights to the process to every important<br/>office-equipment company in the country, only to be turned down every time. Finally, in 1944,<br/>Carlson persuaded Battelle Memorial Institute to undertake further development work on his process<br/>in exchange for three-quarters of any royalties that might accrue from its sale or license.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark162"><span>Here the flashback ends and xerography, as such, comes into being. By 1946, Battelle’s work on<br/>the Carlson process had come to the attention of various people at Haloid, among them the younger<br/>Joseph C. Wilson, who was about to assume the presidency of the company. Wilson communicated<br/>his interest to a new friend of his—Sol M. Linowitz, a bright and vigorously public-spirited young<br/>lawyer, recently back from service in the Navy, who was then busy organizing a new Rochester radio<br/>station that would air liberal views as a counterbalance to the conservative views of the Gannett<br/>newspapers. Although Haloid had its own lawyers, Wilson, impressed with Linowitz, asked him to<br/>look into the Battelle thing as a “one-shot” job for the company. “We went to Columbus to see a piece<br/>of metal rubbed with cat’s fur,” Linowitz has since said. Out of that trip and others came an agreement<br/>giving Haloid rights to the Carlson process in exchange for royalties to Carlson and Battelle, and<br/>committing it to share with Battelle in the work and the costs of development. Everything else, it<br/>seemed, flowed from that agreement. In 1948, in search of a new name for the Carlson process, a<br/>Battelle man got together with a professor of classical languages at Ohio State University, and by<br/>combining two words from classical Greek they came up with “xerography,” or “dry writing.”<br/>Meanwhile, small teams of scientists at Battelle and Haloid, struggling to develop the process, were<br/>encountering baffling and unexpected technical problems one after another; at one point, indeed, the<br/>Haloid people became so discouraged that they considered selling most of their xerography rights to<br/>International Business Machines. But the deal was finally called off, and as the research went on and<br/>the bills for it mounted, Haloid’s commitment to the process gradually became a do-or-die affair. In<br/>1955, a new agreement was drawn up, under which Haloid took over full title to the Carlson patents<br/>and the full cost of the development project, in payment for which it issued huge bundles of Haloid<br/>shares to Battelle, which, in turn, issued a bundle or two to Carlson. The cost was staggering.<br/>Between 1947 and 1960, Haloid spent about seventy-five million dollars on research in xerography,<br/>or about twice what it earned from its regular operations during that period; the balance was raised<br/>through borrowing and through the wholesale issuance of common stock to anyone who was kind,<br/>reckless, or prescient enough to take it. The University of Rochester, partly out of interest in a<br/>struggling local industry, bought an enormous quantity for its endowment fund at a price that<br/>subsequently, because of stock splits, amounted to fifty cents a share. “Please don’t be mad at us if we<br/>find we have to sell our Haloid stock in a couple of years to cut our losses on it,” a university official<br/>nervously warned Wilson. Wilson promised not to be mad. Meanwhile, he and other executives of the</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark163"><span>company took most of their pay in the form of stock, and some of them went as far as to put up their<br/>savings and the mortgages on their houses to help the cause along. (Prominent among the executives<br/>by this time was Linowitz, whose association with Haloid had turned out to be anything but a one-shot<br/>thing; instead, he became Wilson’s right-hand man, taking charge of the company’s crucial patent<br/>arrangements, organizing and guiding its international affiliations, and eventually serving for a time as<br/>chairman of its board of directors.) In 1958, after prayerful consideration, the company’s name was<br/>changed to Haloid Xerox, even though no xerographic product of major importance was yet on the<br/>market. The trademark “XeroX” had been adopted by Haloid several years earlier—a shameless<br/>imitation of Eastman’s “Kodak,” as Wilson has admitted. The terminal “X” soon had to be<br/>downgraded to lower case, because it was found that nobody would bother to capitalize it, but the<br/>near-palindrome, at least as irresistible as Eastman’s, remained. XeroX or Xerox, the trademark,<br/>Wilson has said, was adopted and retained against the vehement advice of many of the firm’s<br/>consultants, who feared that the public would find it unpronounceable, or would think it denoted an<br/>anti-freeze, or would be put in mind of a word highly discouraging to financial ears—“zero.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Then, in 1960, the explosion came, and suddenly everything was reversed. Instead of worrying<br/>about whether its trade name would be successful, the company was worrying about its becoming </span><i>too</i><span>successful, for the new verb “to xerox” began to appear so frequently in conversation and in print that<br/>the company’s proprietary rights in the name were threatened, and it had to embark on an elaborate<br/>campaign against such usage. (In 1961, the company went the whole hog and changed its name to<br/>plain Xerox Corporation.) And instead of worrying about the future of themselves and their families,<br/>the Xerox executives were worrying about their reputation with the friends and relatives whom they<br/>had prudently advised </span><i>not </i><span>to invest in the stock at twenty cents a share. In a word, everybody who<br/>held Xerox stock in quantity had got rich or richer—the executives who had scrimped and sacrificed,<br/>the University of Rochester, Battelle Memorial Institute, and even, of all people, Chester F. Carlson,<br/>who had come out of the various agreements with Xerox stock that at 1968 prices was worth many<br/>million dollars, putting him (according to </span><i>Fortune</i>) among the sixty-six richest people in the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark164">THUS </a><span class="p">baldly outlined, the story of Xerox has an old-fashioned, even a nineteenth-century, ring—the<br/>lonely inventor in his crude laboratory, the small, family-oriented company, the initial setbacks, the<br/>reliance on the patent system, the resort to classical Greek for a trade name, the eventual triumph<br/>gloriously vindicating the free-enterprise system. But there is another dimension to Xerox. In the<br/>matter of demonstrating a sense of responsibility to society as a whole, rather than just to its<br/>stockholders, employees, and customers, it has shown itself to be the reverse of most nineteenth-<br/>century companies—to be, indeed, in the advance guard of twentieth-century companies. “To set high<br/>goals, to have almost unattainable aspirations, to imbue people with the belief that they can be<br/>achieved—these are as important as the balance sheet, perhaps more so,” Wilson said once, and other<br/>Xerox executives have often gone out of their way to emphasize that “the Xerox spirit” is not so much<br/>a means to an end as a matter of emphasizing “human values” for their own sake. Such platform<br/>rhetoric is far from uncommon in big-business circles, of course, and when it comes from Xerox<br/>executives it is just as apt to arouse skepticism—or even, considering the company’s huge profits,<br/>irritation. But there is evidence that Xerox means what it says. In 1965, the company donated</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$1,632,548 to educational and charitable institutions, and $2,246,000 in 1966; both years the biggest<br/>recipients were the University of Rochester and the Rochester Community Chest, and in each case the<br/>sum represented around one and a half per cent of the company’s net income before taxes. This is<br/>markedlyhigher than the percentage that most large companies set aside for good works; to take a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>couple of examples from among those often cited for their liberality, R.C.A.’s contributions for 1965<br/>amounted to about seven-tenths of one per cent of pre-tax income, and American Telephone &amp;<br/>Telegraph’s to considerably less than one per cent. That Xerox intended to persist in its high-minded<br/>ways was indicated by its commitment of itself in 1966 to the “one-per-cent program,” often called<br/>the Cleveland Plan—a system inaugurated in that city under which local industries agree to give one<br/>per cent of pre-tax income annually to local educational institutions, apart from their other donations</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—so that if Xerox income continues to soar, the University of Rochester and its sister institutions in<br/>the area can face the future with a certain assurance.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark165"><span>In other matters, too, Xerox has taken risks for reasons that have nothing to do with profit. In a<br/>1964 speech, Wilson said, “The corporation cannot refuse to take a stand on public issues of major<br/>concern”—a piece of business heresy if there ever was one, since taking a stand on a public issue is<br/>the obvious way of alienating customers and potential customers who take the opposite stand. The<br/>chief public stand that Xerox has taken is in favor of the United Nations—and, by implication, against<br/>its detractors. Early in 1964, the company decided to spend four million dollars—a year’s<br/>advertising budget—on underwriting a series of network-television programs dealing with the U.N.,<br/>the programs to be unaccompanied by commercials or any other identification of Xerox apart from a<br/>statement at the beginning and end of each that Xerox had paid for it. That July and August—some<br/>three months after the decision had been announced—Xerox suddenly received an avalanche of letters<br/>opposing the project and urging the company to abandon it. Numbering almost fifteen thousand, the<br/>letters ranged in tone from sweet reasonableness to strident and emotional denunciation. Many of<br/>them asserted that the U.N. was an instrument for depriving Americans of their Constitutional rights,<br/>that its charter had been written in part by American Communists, and that it was constantly being<br/>used to further Communist objectives, and a few letters, from company presidents, bluntly threatened<br/>to remove the Xerox machines from their offices unless the series was cancelled. Only a handful of<br/>the letter writers mentioned the John Birch Society, and none identified themselves as members of it,<br/>but circumstantial evidence suggested that the avalanche represented a carefully planned Birch<br/>campaign. For one thing, a recent Birch Society publication had urged that members write to Xerox to<br/>protest the U.N. series, pointing out that a flood of letters had succeeded in persuading a major airline<br/>to remove the U.N. insigne from its airplanes. Further evidence of a systematic campaign turned up<br/>when an analysis, made at Xerox’s instigation, showed that the fifteen thousand letters had been<br/>written by only about four thousand persons. In any event, the Xerox offices and directors declined to<br/>be persuaded or intimidated; the U.N. series appeared on the American Broadcasting Company<br/>network in 1965, to plaudits all around. Wilson later maintained that the series—and the decision to<br/>ignore the protest against it—made Xerox many more friends than enemies. In all his public<br/>statements on the subject, he insisted on characterizing what many observers considered a rather rare<br/>stroke of business idealism, as simply sound business judgment.</span></a><a name="bookmark166">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark167">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In the fall of 1966, Xerox began encountering a measure of adversity for the first time since its<br/>introduction of xerography. By that time, there were more than forty companies in the office copier<br/>business, many of them producing xerographic devices under license from Xerox. (The only important<br/>part of its technology for which Xerox had refused to grant a license was a selenium drum that<br/>enables its own machines to make copies on ordinary paper. All competing products still required<br/>treated paper.) The great advantage that Xerox had been enjoying was the one that the first to enter a<br/>new field always enjoys—the advantage of charging high prices. Now, as </span><i>Barron’s </i><span>pointed out in<br/>August, it appeared that “this once-fabulous invention may—as all technological advances inevitably<br/>must—soon evolve into an accepted commonplace.” Cut-rate latecomers were swarming into</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark168"><span>copying; one company, in a letter sent to its stockholders in May, foresaw a time when a copier<br/>selling for ten or twenty dollars could be marketed “as a toy” (one was actually marketed for about<br/>thirty dollars in 1968) and there was even talk of the day when copiers would be given away to<br/>promote sales of paper, the way razors have long given away to promote razor blades. For some<br/>years, realizing that its cozy little monopoly would eventually pass into the public domain, Xerox had<br/>been widening its interests through mergers with companies in other fields, mainly publishing and<br/>education; for example, in 1962 it had bought University Microfilms, a library on microfilm of<br/>unpublished manuscripts, out-of-print books, doctoral dissertations, periodicals, and newspapers, and<br/>in 1965 it had tacked on two other companies—American Education Publications, the country’s<br/>largest publisher of educational periodicals for primary- and secondary-school students, and Basic<br/>Systems, a manufacturer of teaching machines. But these moves failed to reassure that dogmatic critic<br/>the marketplace, and Xerox stock ran into a spell of heavy weather. Between late June, 1966, when it<br/>stood at 267¾, and early October, when it dipped to 131⅝, the market value of the company was<br/>more than cut in half. In the single business week of October 3rd through October 7th, Xerox dropped<br/>42½ points, and on one particularly alarming day—October 6th—trading in Xerox on the New York<br/>Stock Exchange had to be suspended for five hours because there were about twenty-five million<br/>dollars’ worth of shares on sale that no one wanted to buy.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I find that companies are inclined to be at their most interesting when they are undergoing a little<br/>misfortune, and therefore I chose the fall of 1966 as the time to have a look at Xerox and its people—<br/>something I’d had in mind to do for a year or so. I started out by getting acquainted with one of its<br/>products. The Xerox line of copiers and related items was by then a comprehensive one. There was,<br/>for instance, the 914, a desksize machine that makes black-and-white copies of almost any page—<br/>printed, handwritten, typed, or drawn, but not exceeding nine by fourteen inches in size—at a rate of<br/>about one copy every six seconds; the 813, a much smaller device, which can stand on top of a desk<br/>and is essentially a miniaturized version of the 914 (or, as Xerox technicians like to say, “a 914 with<br/>the air left out”); the 2400, a high-speed reproduction machine that looks like a modern kitchen stove<br/>and can cook up copies at a rate of forty a minute, or twenty-four hundred an hour; the Copyflo, which<br/>is capable of enlarging microfilmed pages into ordinary booksize pages and printing them; the LDX,<br/>by which documents can be transmitted over telephone wires, microwave radio, or coaxial cable; and<br/>the Telecopier, a non-xerographic device, designed and manufactured by Magnavox but sold by<br/>Xerox, which is a sort of junior version of the LDX and is especially interesting to a layman because<br/>it consists simply of a small box that, when attached to an ordinary telephone, permits the user to<br/>rapidly transmit a small picture (with a good deal of squeaking and clicking, to be sure) to anyone<br/>equipped with a telephone and a similar small box. Of all these, the 914, the first automatic<br/>xerographic product and the one that constituted the big breakthrough, was still much the most<br/>important both to Xerox and to its customers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It has been suggested that the 914 is the most successful commercial product in history, but the<br/>statement cannot be authoritatively confirmed or denied, if only because Xerox does not publish<br/>precise revenue figures on its individual products; the company does say, though, that in 1965 the 914<br/>accounted for about sixty-two per cent of its total operating revenues, which works out to something<br/>over $243,000,000. In 1966 it could be bought for $27,500, or it could be rented for twenty-five<br/>dollars monthly, plus at least forty-nine dollars’ worth of copies at four cents each. These charges<br/>were deliberately set up to make renting more attractive than buying, because Xerox ultimately makes<br/>more money that way. The 914, which is painted beige and weighs six hundred and fifty pounds,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark169"><span>looks a good deal like a modern L-shaped metal desk; the thing to be copied—a flat page, two pages<br/>of an open book, or even a small three-dimensional object like a watch or a medal—is placed face<br/>down on a glass window in the flat top surface, a button is pushed, and nine seconds later the copy<br/>pops into a tray where an “out” basket might be if the 914 actually were a desk. Technologically, the<br/>914 is so complex (more complex, some Xerox salesmen insist, than an automobile) that it has an<br/>annoying tendency to go wrong, and consequently Xerox maintains a field staff of thousands of<br/>repairmen who are presumably ready to answer a call on short notice. The most common malfunction<br/>is a jamming of the supply of copy paper, which is rather picturesquely called a “mispuff,” because<br/>each sheet of paper is raised into position to be  inscribed by an interior puff of air, and the<br/>malfunction occurs when the puff goes wrong. A bad mispuff can occasionally put a piece of the<br/>paper in contact with hot parts, igniting it and causing an alarming cloud of white smoke to issue from<br/>the machine; in such a case the operator is urged to do nothing, or, at most, to use a small fire<br/>extinguisher that is attached to it, since the fire burns itself out comparatively harmlessly if left alone,<br/>whereas a bucket of water thrown over a 914 may convey potentially lethal voltages to its metal<br/>surface. Apart from malfunctions, the machine requires a good deal of regular attention from its<br/>operator, who is almost invariably a woman. (The girls who operated the earliest typewriters were<br/>themselves called “typewriters,” but fortunately nobody calls Xerox operators “xeroxes.”) Its supply<br/>of copying paper and black electrostatic powder, called “toner,” must be replenished regularly, while<br/>its most crucial part, the selenium drum, must be cleaned regularly with a special non-scratchy cotton,<br/>and waxed every so often. I spent a couple of afternoons with one 914 and its operator, and observed<br/>what seemed to be the closest relationship between a woman and a piece of office equipment that I<br/>had ever seen. A girl who uses a typewriter or switchboard has no interest in the equipment, because<br/>it holds no mystery, while one who operates a computer is bored with it, because it is utterly<br/>incomprehensible. But a 914 has distinct animal traits: it has to be fed and curried; it is intimidating<br/>but can be tamed; it is subject to unpredictable bursts of misbehavior; and, generally speaking, it<br/>responds in kind to its treatment. “I was frightened of it at first,” the operator I watched told me. “The<br/>Xerox men say, ‘If you’re frightened of it, it won’t work,’ and that’s pretty much right. It’s a good<br/>scout; I’m fond of it now.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark170"><span>Xerox salesmen, I learned from talks with some of them, are forever trying to think of new uses for<br/>the company’s copiers, but they have found again and again that the public is well ahead of them. One<br/>rather odd use of xerography insures that brides get the wedding presents they want. The prospective<br/>bride submits her list of preferred presents to a department store; the store sends the list to its bridal-<br/>registry counter, which is equipped with a Xerox copier; each friend of the bride, having been<br/>tactfully briefed in advance, comes to this counter and is issued a copy of the list, whereupon he does<br/>his shopping and then returns the copy with the purchased items checked off, so that the master list<br/>may be revised and thus ready for the next donor. (“Hymen, iö Hymen, Hymen!”) Again, police<br/>departments in New Orleans and various other places, instead of laboriously typing up a receipt for<br/>the property removed from people who spend the night in the lockup, now place the property itself—<br/>wallet, watch, keys, and such—on the scanning glass of a 914, and in a few seconds have a sort of<br/>pictographic receipt. Hospitals use xerography to copy electrocardiograms and laboratory reports,<br/>and brokerage firms to get hot tips to customers more quickly. In fact, anybody with any sort of idea<br/>that might be advanced by copying can go to one of the many cigar or stationery stores that have a<br/>coin-operated copier and indulge himself. (It is interesting to note that Xerox took to producing coin-<br/>operated 914s in two configurations—one that works for a dime and one that works for a quarter; the<br/>buyer or leaser of the machine could decide which he wanted to charge.)</span></a><a name="bookmark171">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Copying has its abuses, too, and they are clearly serious. The most obvious one is overcopying. A<br/>tendency formerly identified with bureaucrats has been spreading—the urge to make two or more<br/>copies when one would do, and to make one when none would do; the phrase “in triplicate,” once<br/>used to denote bureaucratic waste, has become a gross understatement. The button waiting to be<br/>pushed,  the whir of action, the neat reproduction dropping into the tray—all this adds up to a heady<br/>experience, and the neophyte operator of a copier feels an impulse to copy all the papers in his<br/>pockets. And once one has used a copier, one tends to be hooked. Perhaps the chief danger of this<br/>addiction is not so much the cluttering up of files and loss of important material through submersion<br/>as it is the insidious growth of a negative attitude toward originals—a feeling that nothing can be of<br/>importance </span><i>unless </i>it is copied, or is a copy itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark172"><span>A more immediate problem of xerography is the overwhelming temptation it offers to violate the<br/>copyright laws. Almost all large public and college libraries—and many high-school libraries as<br/>well—are now equipped with copying machines, and teachers and students in need of a few copies of<br/>a group of poems from a published book, a certain short story from an anthology, or a certain article<br/>from a scholarly journal have developed the habit of simply plucking it from the library’s shelves,<br/>taking it to the library’s reproduction department, and having the required number of Xerox copies<br/>made. The effect, of course, is to deprive the author and the publisher of income. There are no legal<br/>records of such infringements of copyright, since publishers and authors almost never sue educators,<br/>if only because they don’t know that the infringements have occurred; furthermore, the educators<br/>themselves often have no idea that they have done anything illegal. The likelihood that many<br/>copyrights have already been infringed unknowingly through xerography became indirectly apparent a<br/>few years ago when a committee of educators sent a circular to teachers from coast to coast informing<br/>them explicitly what rights to reproduce copyrighted material they did and did not have, and the<br/>almost instant sequel was a marked rise in the number of requests from educators to publishers for<br/>permissions. And there was more concrete evidence of the way things were going; for example, in<br/>1965 a staff member of the library school of the University of New Mexico publicly advocated that<br/>libraries spend ninety per cent of their budgets on staff, telephones, copying, telefacsimiles, and the<br/>like, and only ten per cent—a sort of tithe—on books and journals.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark173"><span>To a certain extent, libraries attempt to police copying on their own. The photographic service of<br/>the New York Public Library’s main branch, which fills some fifteen hundred requests a week for<br/>copies of library matter, informs patrons that “copyrighted material will not be reproduced beyond<br/>‘fair use’”—that is, the amount and kind of reproduction, generally confined to brief excerpts, that<br/>have been established by legal precedent as not constituting infringement. The library goes on, “The<br/>applicant assumes all responsibility for any question that may arise in the making of the copy and in<br/>the use made thereof.” In the first part of its statement the library seems to assume the responsibility<br/>and in the second part to renounce it, and this ambivalence may reflect an uneasiness widely felt<br/>among users of library copiers. Outside library walls, there often does not seem to be even this<br/>degree of scruple. Business people who are otherwise meticulous in their observance of the law seem<br/>to regard copyright infringement about as seriously as they regard jaywalking. A writer I’ve heard<br/>about was invited to a seminar of high-level and high-minded industrial leaders and was startled to<br/>find that a chapter from his most recent book had been copied and distributed to the participants, to<br/>serve as a basis for discussion. When the writer protested, the businessmen were taken aback, and<br/>even injured; they had thought the writer would be pleased by their attention to his work, but the<br/>flattery, after all, was of the sort shown by a thief who commends a lady’s jewelry by making off with<br/>it.</span></a><a name="bookmark174">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark175"><span>In the opinion of some commentators, what has happened so far is only the first phase of a kind of<br/>revolution in graphics. “Xerography is bringing a reign of terror into the world of publishing, because<br/>it means that every reader can become both author and publisher,” the Canadian sage Marshall<br/>McLuhan wrote in the spring, 1966, issue of the </span></a><i>American Scholar</i><span>. “Authorship and readership alike<br/>can become production-oriented under xerography.… Xerography is electricity invading the world of<br/>typography, and it means a total revolution in this old sphere.” Even allowing for McLuhan’s erratic<br/>ebullience (“I change my opinions daily,” he once confessed), he seems to have got his teeth into<br/>something here. Various magazine articles have predicted nothing less than the disappearance of the<br/>book as it now exists, and pictured the library of the future as a sort of monster computer capable of<br/>storing and retrieving the contents of books electronically and xerographically. The “books” in such a<br/>library would be tiny chips of computer film—“editions of one.” Everyone agrees that such a library<br/>is still some time away. (But not so far away as to preclude a wary reaction from forehanded<br/>publishers. Beginning late in 1966, the long-familiar “all rights reserved” rigmarole on the copyright<br/>page of all books published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; World was altered to read, a bit spookily, “All<br/>rights reserved. No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any<br/>means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopy, recording, or any information storage and<br/>retrieval system …” Other publishers quickly followed the example.) One of the nearest approaches<br/>to it in the late sixties was the Xerox subsidiary University Microfilms, which could, and did, enlarge<br/>its microfilms of out-of-print books and print them as attractive and highly legible paperback<br/>volumes, at a cost to the customer of four cents a page; in cases where the book was covered by<br/>copyright, the firm paid a royalty to the author on each copy produced. But the time when almost<br/>anyone can make his own copy of a published book at lower than the market price is not some years<br/>away; it is now. All that the amateur publisher needs is access to a Xerox machine and a small offset<br/>printing press. One of the lesser but still important attributes of xerography is its ability to make<br/>master copies for use on offset presses, and make them much more cheaply and quickly than was<br/>previously possible. According to Irwin Karp, counsel to the Authors League of America, an edition<br/>of fifty copies of any printed book could in 1967 be handsomely “published” (minus the binding) by<br/>this combination of technologies in a matter of minutes at a cost of about eight-tenths of a cent per<br/>page, and less than that if the edition was larger. A teacher wishing to distribute to a class of fifty<br/>students the contents of a sixty-four-page book of poetry selling for three dollars and seventy-five<br/>cents could do so, if he were disposed to ignore the copyright laws, at a cost of slightly over fifty<br/>cents per copy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark176"><span>The danger in the new technology, authors and publishers have contended, is that in doing away<br/>with the book it may do away with them, and thus with writing itself. Herbert S. Bailey, Jr., director<br/>of Princeton University Press, wrote in the </span></a><i>Saturday Review </i><span>of a scholar friend of his who has<br/>cancelled all his subscriptions to scholarly journals; instead, he now scans their tables of contents at<br/>his public library and makes copies of the articles that interest him. Bailey commented, “If all<br/>scholars followed [this] practice, there would be no scholarly journals.” Beginning in the middle<br/>sixties, Congress has been considering a revision of the copyright laws—the first since 1909. At the<br/>hearings, a committee representing the National Education Association and a clutch of other education<br/>groups argued firmly and persuasively that if education is to keep up with our national growth, the<br/>present copyright law and the fair-use doctrine should be liberalized for scholastic purposes. The<br/>authors and publishers, not surprisingly, opposed such liberalization, insisting that any extension of<br/>existing rights would tend to deprive them of their livelihoods to some degree now, and to a far<br/>greater degree in the uncharted xerographic future. A bill that was approved in 1967 by the House</span><a name="bookmark177">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Judiciary Committee seemed to represent a victory for them, since it explicitly set forth the fair-use<br/>doctrine  and contained no educational-copying exemption. But the final outcome of the struggle was<br/>still uncertain late in 1968. McLuhan, for one, was convinced that all efforts to preserve the old forms<br/>of author protection represent backward thinking and are doomed to failure (or, anyway, he was<br/>convinced the day he wrote his </span><i>American Scholar </i><span>article). “There is no possible protection from<br/>technology except by technology,” he wrote. “When you create a new environment with one phase of<br/>technology, you have to create an anti-environment with the next.” But authors are seldom good at<br/>technology, and probably do not flourish in anti-environments.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark178"><span>In dealing with this Pandora’s box that Xerox products have opened, the company seems to have<br/>measured up tolerably well to its lofty ideals as set forth by Wilson. Although it has a commercial<br/>interest in encouraging—or, at least, not </span></a><i>dis</i><span>couraging—more and more copying of just about anything<br/>that can be read, it makes more than a token effort to inform the users of its machines of their legal<br/>responsibilities; for example, each new machine that is shipped out is accompanied by a cardboard<br/>poster giving a long list of things that may not be copied, among them paper money, government<br/>bonds, postage stamps, passports, and “copyrighted material of any manner or kind without<br/>permission of the copyright owner.” (How many of these posters end up in wastebaskets is another<br/>matter.) Moreover, caught in the middle between the contending factions in the fight over revision of<br/>copyright law, it resisted the temptation to stand piously aside while raking in the profits, and showed<br/>an exemplary sense of social responsibility—at least from the point of view of the authors and<br/>publishers. The copying industry in general, by contrast, tended either to remain neutral or to lean to<br/>the educators’ side. At a 1963 symposium on copyright revision, an industry spokesman went as far<br/>as to argue that machine copying by a scholar is merely a convenient extension of hand copying,<br/>which has traditionally been accepted as legitimate. But not Xerox. Instead, in September, 1965,<br/>Wilson  wrote to the House Judiciary  Committee flatly opposing  any  kind of special copying<br/>exemption in any new law. Of course, in evaluating this seemingly quixotic stand one ought to<br/>remember that Xerox is a publishing firm as well as a copying-machine firm; indeed, what with<br/>American Education Publications and University Microfilms, it is one of the largest publishing firms<br/>in the country. Conventional publishers, I gathered from my researches, sometimes find it a bit<br/>bewildering to be confronted by this futuristic giant not merely as an alien threat to their familiar<br/>world but as an energetic colleague and competitor within it.</span><a name="bookmark179">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HAVING <span class="p">had a look at some Xerox products and devoted some thought to the social implications of<br/>their use, I went to Rochester to scrape up a first-hand acquaintance with the company and to get an<br/>idea how its people were reacting to their problems, material and moral. At the time I went, the<br/>material problems certainly seemed to be to the fore, since the week of the forty-two-and-a-half-point<br/>stock drop was not long past. On the plane en route, I had before me a copy of Xerox’s most recent<br/>proxy statement, which listed the number of Xerox shares held by each director as of February, 1966,<br/>and I amused myself by calculating some of the directors’ paper losses in that one bad October week,<br/>assuming that they had held on to their stock. Chairman Wilson, for example, had held 154,026<br/>common shares in February, so his loss would have been $6,546,105. Linowitz’s holding was 35,166<br/>shares, for a loss of $1,494,555. Dr. John H. Dessauer, executive vice-president in charge of<br/>research, had held 73,845 shares and was therefore presumably out $3,138,412.50. Such sums could<br/>hardly be considered trivial even by Xerox executives. Would I, then, find their premises pervaded<br/>by gloom, or at least by signs of shock?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Xerox executive offices were on the upper floors of Rochester’s Midtown Tower, the ground</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark180"><span>level of which is occupied by Midtown Plaza, an indoor shopping mall. (Later that year, the company<br/>moved its headquarters across the street to Xerox Square, a complex that includes a thirty-story office<br/>building, an auditorium for civic as well as company use, and a sunken ice rink.) Before going up to<br/>the Xerox offices, I took a turn or two around the mall, and found it to be equipped with all kinds of<br/>shops, a café, kiosks, pools, trees, and benches that—in spite of an oppressively bland and affluent<br/>atmosphere, created mainly, I suspect, by bland piped-in music—were occupied in part by bums, just<br/>like       the benches in outdoor malls. The trees had a tendency to languish for lack of light and air, but the<br/>bums looked O.K. Having ascended by elevator, I met a Xerox public-relations man with whom I had<br/>an appointment, and immediately asked him how the company had reacted to the stock drop. “Oh,<br/>nobody takes it too seriously,” he replied. “You hear a lot of lighthearted talk about it at the golf<br/>clubs. One fellow will say to another, ‘You buy the drinks—I dropped another eighty thousand<br/>dollars on Xerox yesterday.’ Joe Wilson </span></a><i>did </i><span>find it a bit traumatic that day they had to suspend<br/>trading on the Stock Exchange, but otherwise he took it in stride. In fact, at a party the other day when<br/>the stock was way down and a lot of people were clustering around him asking him what it all meant,<br/>I heard him say, ‘Well, you know, it’s very rarely that opportunity knocks twice.’ As for the office,<br/>you scarcely hear the subject mentioned at all.” As a matter of fact, I scarcely did hear it mentioned<br/>again while I was at Xerox, and this sang-froid turned out to be justified, because within a little more<br/>than a month the stock had made up its entire loss, and within a few more months it had moved up to<br/>an all-time high.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I spent the rest of that morning calling on three scientific and technical Xerox men and listening to<br/>nostalgic tales of the early years of xerographic development. The first of these men was Dr.<br/>Dessauer, the previous week’s three-million-dollar loser, whom I nevertheless found looking tranquil</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark181"><span>—as I guess I should have expected, in view of the fact that his Xerox stock was still presumably<br/>worth more than nine and a half million dollars. (A few months later it was presumably worth not<br/>quite </span></a><i>twenty </i><span>million.) Dr. Dessauer, a German-born veteran of the company who had been in charge<br/>of its research and engineering ever since 1938 and was then also vice-chairman of its board, was the<br/>man who first brought Carlson’s invention to the attention of Joseph Wilson, after he had read an<br/>article about it in a technical journal in 1945. Stuck up on his office wall, I noticed, was a greeting<br/>card from members of his office staff in which he was hailed as the “Wizard,” and I found him to be a<br/>smiling, youthful-looking man with just enough of an accent to pass muster for wizardry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“You want to hear about the old days, eh?” Dr. Dessauer said. “Well, it was exciting. It was<br/>wonderful. It was also terrible. Sometimes I was going out of my mind, more or less literally. Money<br/>was the main problem. The company was fortunate in being modestly in the black, but not far enough.<br/>The members of our team were all gambling on the project. I even mortgaged my house—all I had left<br/>was my life insurance. My neck was way out. My feeling was that if it didn’t work Wilson and I<br/>would be business failures but as far as I was concerned I’d also be a technical failure. Nobody<br/>would ever give me a job again. I’d have to give up science and sell insurance or something.” Dr.<br/>Dessauer threw a retrospectively distracted glance at the ceiling and went on, “Hardly anybody was<br/>very optimistic in the early years. Various members of our own group would come in and tell me that<br/>the damn thing would never work. The biggest risk was that electrostatics would prove to be not<br/>feasible in high humidity. Almost all the experts assumed that—they’d say, ‘You’ll never make copies<br/>in New Orleans.’ And even if it did work, the marketing people thought we were dealing with a<br/>potential market of no more than a few thousand machines. Some advisers told us that we were<br/>absolutely crazy to go ahead with the project. Well, as you know, everything worked out all right—<br/>the 914 worked, even in New Orleans, and there was a big market for it. Then came the desk-top</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>version, the 813. I stuck my neck way out again on that, holding out for a design that some experts<br/>considered too fragile.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I asked Dr. Dessauer whether his neck was now out on anything in the way of new research, and, if<br/>so, whether it is as exciting as xerography was. He replied, “Yes to both questions, but beyond that<br/>the subject is privileged knowledge.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark182"><span>Dr. Harold E. Clark, the next man I saw, had been in direct charge of the xerography-development<br/>program under Dr. Dessauer’s supervision, and he gave me more details on how the Carlson<br/>invention had been coaxed and nursed into a commercial product. “Chet Carlson was<br/>morphological,” began Dr. Clark, a short man with a professorial manner who was, in fact, a<br/>professor of physics before he came to Haloid in 1949. I probably looked blank, because Dr. Clark<br/>gave a little laugh and went on, “I don’t really know whether ‘morphological’ means anything. I </span></a><i>think</i><span>it means putting one thing together with another thing to get a new thing. Anyway, that’s what Chet<br/>was. Xerography had practically no foundation in previous scientific work. Chet put together a rather<br/>odd lot of phenomena, each of which was obscure in itself and none of which had previously been<br/>related in anyone’s thinking. The result was the biggest thing in imaging since the coming of<br/>photography itself. Furthermore, he did it entirely without the help of a favorable scientific climate.<br/>As you know, there are dozens of instances of simultaneous discovery down through scientific<br/>history, but no one came anywhere near being simultaneous with Chet. I’m as amazed by his<br/>discovery now as I was when I first heard of it. As an invention, it was magnificent. The only trouble<br/>was that as a product it wasn’t any good.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Dr. Clark gave another little laugh and went on to explain that the turning point was reached at the<br/>Battelle Memorial Institute, and in a manner fully consonant with the tradition of scientific advances’<br/>occurring more or less by mistake. The main trouble was that Carlson’s photoconductive surface,<br/>which was coated with sulphur, lost its qualities after it had made a few copies and became useless.<br/>Acting on a hunch unsupported by scientific theory, the Battelle researchers tried adding to the<br/>sulphur a small quantity of selenium, a non-metallic element previously used chiefly in electrical<br/>resistors and as a coloring material to redden glass. The selenium-and-sulphur surface worked a little<br/>better than the all-sulphur one, so the Battelle men tried adding a little more selenium. More<br/>improvement. They gradually kept increasing the percentage until they had a surface consisting<br/>entirely of selenium—no sulphur. That one worked best of all, and thus it was found, backhandedly,<br/>that selenium and selenium alone could make xerography practical.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark183"><span>“Think of it,” Dr. Clark said, looking thoughtful himself. “A simple thing like selenium—one of the<br/>earth’s elements, of which there are hardly more than a hundred altogether, and a common one at that.<br/>It turned out to be the key. Once its effectiveness was discovered, we were around the corner,<br/>although we  didn’t know it at the  time. We still hold patents covering the use of selenium in<br/>xerography—almost a patent on one of the elements. Not bad, eh? Nor do we understand exactly </span></a><i>how</i><span>selenium works, even now. We’re mystified, for example, by the fact that it has no memory effects—<br/>no traces of previous copies are left on the selenium-coated drum—and that it seems to be<br/>theoretically capable of lasting indefinitely. In the lab, a selenium-coated drum will last through a<br/>million processes, and we don’t understand why it wears out even then. So, you see, the development<br/>of xerography was largely empirical. We were trained scientists, not Yankee tinkers, but we struck a<br/>balance between Yankee tinkering and scientific inquiry.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Next, I talked with Horace W. Becker, the Xerox engineer who was principally responsible for<br/>bringing the 914 from the working-model stage to the production line. A Brooklynite with a talent,<br/>appropriate to his assignment, for eloquent anguish, he told me of the hair-raising obstacles and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>hazards that surrounded this progress. When he joined Haloid Xerox in 1958, his laboratory was a<br/>loft above a Rochester garden-seed–packaging establishment; something was wrong with the roof,<br/>and on hot days drops of molten tar would ooze through it and spatter the engineers and the machines.<br/>The 914 finally came of age in another lab, on Orchard Street, early in 1960. “It was a beat-up old<br/>loft building, too, with a creaky elevator and a view of a railroad siding where cars full of pigs kept<br/>going by,” Becker told me, “but we had the space we needed, and it didn’t drip tar. It was at Orchard<br/>Street that we finally caught fire. Don’t ask me how it happened. We decided it was time to set up an<br/>assembly line, and we did. Everybody was keyed up. The union people temporarily forgot their<br/>grievances, and the bosses forgot their performance ratings. You couldn’t tell an engineer from an<br/>assembler in that place. No one could stay away—you’d sneak in on a Sunday, when the assembly<br/>line was shut down, and there would be somebody adjusting something or just puttering around and<br/>admiring our work. In other words, the 914 was on its way at last.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark184"><span>But once the machine was on its way out of the shop and on to showrooms and customers, Becker<br/>related, his troubles had only begun, because he was now held responsible for malfunctions and<br/>design deficiencies, and when it came to having a spectacular collapse just at the moment when the<br/>public spotlight was full on it, the 914 turned out to be a veritable Edsel. Intricate relays declined to<br/>work, springs broke, power supplies failed, inexperienced users dropped staples and paper clips into<br/>it and fouled the works (necessitating the installation in every machine of a staple-catcher), and the<br/>expected difficulties in humid climates developed, along with unanticipated ones at high altitudes.<br/>“All in all,” Becker said, “at that time the machines had a bad habit, when you pressed the button, of<br/>doing nothing.” Or if the machines did do something, it was something wrong. At the 914’s first big<br/>showing in London, for instance, Wilson himself was on hand to put a ceremonial forefinger to its<br/>button; he did so, and not only was no copy made but a giant generator serving the line was blown<br/>out. Thus was xerography introduced in Great Britain, and, considering the nature of its début, the fact<br/>that Britain later become far and away the biggest overseas user of the 914 appears to be a tribute to<br/>both Xerox resilience and British patience.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>That afternoon, a Xerox guide drove me out to Webster, a farm town near the edge of Lake Ontario,<br/>a few miles from Rochester, to see the incongruous successor to Becker’s leaky and drafty lofts—a<br/>huge complex of modern industrial buildings, including one of roughly a million square feet where all<br/>Xerox copiers are assembled (except those made by the company’s affiliates in Britain and Japan),<br/>and another, somewhat smaller but more svelte, where research and development are carried out. As<br/>we walked down one of the humming production lines in the manufacturing building, my guide<br/>explained that the line operates sixteen hours a day on two shifts, that it and the other lines have been<br/>lagging behind demand continuously for several years, that there are now almost two thousand<br/>employees working in the building, and that their union is a local of the Amalgamated Clothing<br/>Workers of America, this anomaly being due chiefly to the fact that Rochester used to be a center of<br/>the clothing business and the Clothing Workers has long been the strongest union in the area.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark185"><span>After my guide had delivered me back to Rochester, I set out on my own to collect some opinions<br/>on the community’s attitude toward Xerox and its success. I found them to be ambivalent. “Xerox has<br/>been a good thing for Rochester,” said a local businessman. “Eastman Kodak, of course, was the<br/>city’s Great White Father for years, and it is still far and away the biggest local business, although<br/>Xerox is now second and coming up fast. Facing that kind of challenge doesn’t do Kodak any harm—<br/>in fact, it does it a lot of good. Besides, a successful new local company means new money and new<br/>jobs. On the other hand, some people around here resent Xerox. Most of the local industries go back<br/>to the nineteenth century, and their people aren’t always noted for receptiveness to newcomers. When</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Xerox was going through its meteoric rise, some thought the bubble would burst—no, they <i>hoped </i><span>it<br/>would burst. On top of that, there’s been a certain amount of feeling against the way Joe Wilson and<br/>Sol Linowitz are always talking about human values while making money hand over fist. But, you<br/>know—the price of success.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark186"><span>I went out to the University of Rochester, high on the banks of the Genesee River, and had a talk<br/>with its president, W. Allen Wallis. A tall man with red hair, trained as a statistician, Wallis served<br/>on the boards of several Rochester companies, including Eastman Kodak, which had always been the<br/>university’s Santa Claus and remained its biggest annual benefactor. As for Xerox, the university had<br/>several sound reasons for feeling kindly toward it. In the first place, the university was a prize<br/>example of a Xerox </span></a><i>multi</i><span>millionaire, since its clear capital gain on the investment amounted to<br/>around a hundred million dollars and it had taken out more than ten million in profits. In the second<br/>place, Xerox annually comes through with annual cash gifts second only to Kodak’s, and had recently<br/>pledged nearly six million dollars to the university’s capital-funds drive. In the third place, Wilson, a<br/>University of Rochester graduate himself, had been on the university’s board of trustees since 1949<br/>and its chairman since 1959. “Before I came here, in 1962, I’d never even heard of corporations’<br/>giving universities such sums as Kodak and Xerox give us now,” President Wallis said. “And all they<br/>want in return is for us to provide top-quality education—not do their research for them, or anything<br/>like that. Oh, there’s a good deal of informal technical consulting between our scientific people and<br/>the Xerox people—same thing with Kodak, Bausch &amp; Lomb, and others—but that’s not why they’re<br/>supporting the university. They want to make Rochester a place that will be attractive to the people<br/>they want here. The university has never invented anything for Xerox, and I guess it never will.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The next morning, in the Xerox executive offices, I met the three nontechnical Xerox men of the<br/>highest magnitude, ending with Wilson himself. The first of these was Linowitz, the lawyer whom<br/>Wilson took on “temporarily” in 1946 and kept on permanently as his least dispensable aide. (Since<br/>Xerox became famous, the general public tended to think of Linowitz as more than that—as, in fact,<br/>the company’s chief executive. Xerox officials were aware of this popular misconception, and were<br/>mystified by it, since Wilson, whether he was called president, as he was until May of 1966, or<br/>chairman of the board, as he was after that, had been the boss right along.) I caught Linowitz almost<br/>literally on the run, since he had just been appointed United States Ambassador to the Organization of<br/>American States and was about to leave Rochester and Xerox for Washington and his new duties. A<br/>vigorous man in his fifties, he fairly exuded drive, intensity, and sincerity. After apologizing for the<br/>fact that he had only a few minutes to spend with me, he said, rapidly, that in his opinion the success<br/>of Xerox was proof that the old ideals of free enterprise still held true, and that the qualities that had<br/>made for the company’s success were idealism, tenacity, the courage to take risks, and enthusiasm.<br/>With that, he waved goodbye and was off. I was left feeling a little like a whistle-stop voter who has<br/>just been briefly addressed by a candidate from the rear platform of a campaign train, but, like many<br/>such voters, I was impressed. Linowitz had used those banal words not merely as if he meant them but<br/>as if he had invented them, and I had the feeling that Wilson and Xerox were going to miss him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark187"><span>I found C. Peter McColough, who had been president of the company since Wilson had moved up<br/>to chairman, and who was apparently destined eventually to succeed him as boss (as he did in 1968),<br/>pacing his office like a caged animal, pausing from time to time at a standup desk, where he would<br/>scribble something or bark a few words into a dictating machine. A liberal Democratic lawyer, like<br/>Linowitz, but a Canadian by birth, he is a cheerful extrovert who, being in his early forties, was<br/>spoken of as representing a new Xerox generation, charged with determining the course that the<br/>company would take next. “I face the problems of growth,” he told me after he had abandoned his</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>pacing for a restless perch on the edge of a chair. Future growth on a large scale simply isn’t possible<br/>in xerography, he went on—there isn’t room enough left—and the direction that Xerox is taking is<br/>toward educational techniques. He mentioned computers and teaching machines, and when he said he<br/>could “dream of a system whereby you’d write stuff in Connecticut and within hours reprint it in<br/>classrooms all over the country,” I got the feeling that some of Xerox’s educational dreams could<br/>easily become nightmares. But then he added, “The danger in ingenious hardware is that it distracts<br/>attention from education. What good is a wonderful machine if you don’t know what to put on it?”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>McColough said that since he came to Haloid, in 1954, he felt he’d been part of three entirely<br/>differentcompanies—until 1959 a small one engaged in a dangerous and exciting gamble; from 1959<br/>to 1964 a growing one enjoying the fruits of victory; and now a huge one branching out in new<br/>directions. I asked him which one he liked best, and he thought a long time. “I don’t know,” he said<br/>finally. “I used to feel greater freedom, and I used to feel that everyone in the company shared<br/>attitudes on specific matters like labor relations. I don’t feel that way so much now. The pressures are<br/>greater, and the company is more impersonal. I wouldn’t say that life has become easier, or that it is<br/>likely to get easier in the future.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Of all the surprising things about Joseph C. Wilson, not the least, I thought when I was ushered into<br/>his presence, was the fact that his office walls were decorated with old-fashioned flowered<br/>wallpaper. A sentimental streak in the man at the head of Xerox seemed the most unlikely of<br/>anomalies. But he had a homey, unthreatening bearing to go with the wallpaper; a smallish man in his<br/>late fifties, he looked serious—almost grave—during most of my visit, and spoke in a slow, rather<br/>hesitant way. I asked him how he had happened to go into his family’s business, and he replied that as<br/>a matter of fact he nearly hadn’t. English literature had been his second major at the university, and he<br/>had considered either taking up teaching or going into the financial and administrative end of<br/>university work. But after graduating he had gone on to the Harvard Business School, where he had<br/>been a top student, and somehow or other … In any case, he had joined Haloid the year he left<br/>Harvard, and there, he told me with a sudden smile, he was.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The subjects that Wilson seemed to be most keen on discussing were Xerox’s non-profit activities<br/>and his theories of corporate responsibility. “There are certain feelings of resentment toward us on<br/>this,” he said. “I don’t mean just from stockholders complaining that we’re giving their money away</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—that point of view is losing ground. I mean in the community. You don’t actually hear it, but you<br/>sometimes get a kind of intuitive feeling that people are saying, ‘Who do these young upstarts think<br/>they are, anyhow?’”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I asked whether the letter-writing campaign against the U.N. television series had caused any<br/>misgivings or downright faintheartedness within the company, and he said, “As an organization, we<br/>never wavered. Almost without exception, the people here felt that the attacks only served to call<br/>attention to the very point we were trying to make—that world coöperation is our business, because<br/>without it there might be no world and therefore no business. We believe we followed sound business<br/>policy in going ahead with the series. At the same time, I won’t maintain that it was </span><i>only </i><span>sound<br/>business policy. I doubt whether we would have done it if, let’s say, we had all been Birchers<br/>ourselves.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark188"><span>Wilson went on slowly, “The whole matter of committing the company to taking stands on major<br/>public issues raises questions that make us examine ourselves all the time. It’s a matter of balance.<br/>You can’t just be bland, or you throw away your influence. But you can’t take a stand on every major<br/>issue, either. We don’t think it’s a corporation’s job to take stands on national elections, for example</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—fortunately, perhaps, since Sol Linowitz is a Democrat and I’m a Republican. Issues like university</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">education, civil rights, and Negro employment clearly <i>are </i><span>our business. I’d hope that we would have<br/>the courage to stand up for a point of view that was unpopular if we thought it was appropriate to do<br/>so. So far, we haven’t faced that situation—we haven’t found a conflict between what we consider<br/>our civic responsibility and good business. But the time may come. We may have to stand on the<br/>firing line yet. For example, we’ve tried, without much fanfare, to equip some Negro youths to take<br/>jobs beyond sweeping the floor and so on. The program required complete coöperation from our<br/>union, and we got it. But I’ve learned that, in subtle ways, the honeymoon is over. There’s an<br/>undercurrent of opposition. Here’s something started, then, that if it grows could confront us with a<br/>real business problem. If it becomes a few hundred objectors instead of a few dozen, things might<br/>even come to a strike, and in such a case I hope we and the union leadership would stand up and fight.<br/>But I don’t really know.

He nodded briefly and said, “It’s<br/>an everlasting battle, which we may or may not win.”</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark189">6</a><a name="bookmark190">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark191">Making the Customers Whole</a><a name="bookmark192">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark193">ON THE MORNING </a><span class="p">of Tuesday, November 19th, 1963, a well-dressed but haggard-looking man in his<br/>middle thirties presented himself at the executive offices of the New York Stock Exchange, at 11<br/>Wall Street, with the announcement that he was Morton Kamerman, managing partner of the brokerage<br/>firm of Ira Haupt &amp; Co., a member of the Stock Exchange, and that he wanted to see Frank J. Coyle,<br/>head of the Exchange’s member-firms department. After checking, a receptionist explained politely<br/>that Mr. Coyle was tied up in a meeting, whereupon the visitor said that his mission was an urgent one<br/>and asked to see Robert M. Bishop, the department’s second-in-command. Bishop, the receptionist<br/>found, was unavailable, too; he was tied up with an important phone call. At length, Kamerman, who<br/>seemed to be growing more and more distracted, was ushered into the presence of a less exalted<br/>Exchange official named George H. Newman. He then duly delivered his message—that, to the best<br/>of his belief, the capital reserve of the Haupt firm had fallen below the Exchange’s requirements for<br/>member firms, and that he was formally reporting the fact, in accordance with regulations. While this<br/>startling announcement was being made, Bishop, in a nearby office, was continuing his important<br/>telephone conversation, the second party to which was a knowledgeable Wall Streeter whom Bishop<br/>has since declined to identify. The caller was telling Bishop he had reason to believe that two Stock<br/>Exchange member firms—J. R. Williston &amp; Beane, Inc., and Ira Haupt &amp; Co.—were in financial<br/>trouble serious enough to warrant the Exchange’s attention. After hanging up, Bishop made an<br/>interoffice call to Newman to tell him what he had just heard. To Bishop’s surprise, Newman already<br/>had the news, or part of it. “As a matter of fact, Kamerman is right here with me now,” he said.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark194"><span>In this humdrum setting of office confusion there began one of the most trying—and in some ways<br/>one of the most serious—crises in the Stock Exchange’s long history. Before it was over, this crisis<br/>had been exacerbated by the greater crisis resulting from the assassination of President Kennedy, and<br/>out of it the Stock Exchange—which has not always been noted for acting in the public interest, and,<br/>indeed, had been accused only a few months before by the Securities and Exchange Commission of an<br/>anti-social tendency to conduct itself like a private club—emerged temporarily poorer by almost ten<br/>million dollars but incalculably richer in the esteem of at least some of its countrymen. The event that<br/>had brought Haupt and Williston &amp; Beane into straitened circumstances is history—or, rather, future<br/>history. It was the sudden souring of a huge speculation that these two firms (along with various<br/>brokers not members of the Stock Exchange) had become involved in on behalf of a single customer</span></a><a name="bookmark195">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil &amp; Refining Co., of Bayonne, New Jersey. The speculation was in<br/>contracts to buy vast quantities of cottonseed oil and soybean oil for future delivery. Such contracts<br/>are known as commodity futures, and the element of speculation in them lies in the possibility that by<br/>delivery date the commodity will be worth more (or less) than the contract price. Vegetable-oil<br/>futures are traded daily at the New York Produce Exchange, at 2 Broadway, and at the Board of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark196"><span>Trade, in Chicago, and they are bought and sold on behalf of customers by about eighty of the four<br/>hundred-odd firms that belong to the Stock Exchange and conduct a public business. On the day that<br/>Kamerman came to the Exchange, the Haupt firm was holding for Allied—on credit—so many<br/>cottonseed-oil and soybean-oil contracts that the change of a single penny per pound in the prices of<br/>the commodities meant a twelve-million-dollar change in the value of the Allied account with Haupt.<br/>On the two previous business days—Friday the fifteenth and Monday the eighteenth—the prices had<br/>dropped an average of a little less than a cent and a half per pound, and as a result Haupt had<br/>demanded that Allied put up about fifteen million dollars in cash to keep the account seaworthy.<br/>Allied had declined to do this, so Haupt—like any broker when a customer operating on credit has<br/>defaulted—was faced with the necessity of selling out the Allied contracts to get back what it could<br/>of its advances. The suicidal extent of the risk that Haupt had undertaken is further indicated by the<br/>fact that while the firm’s capital in early November had amounted to only about eight million dollars,<br/>it had borrowed enough money to supply a single customer—Allied—with some thirty-seven million<br/>dollars to finance the oil speculations. Worse still, as things turned out it had accepted as collateral<br/>for some of these advances enormous amounts of actual cottonseed oil and soybean oil from Allied’s<br/>inventory, the presence of which in tanks at Bayonne was attested to by warehouse receipts stating the<br/>precise amount and kind of oil on hand. Haupt had borrowed the money it supplied Allied with from<br/>various banks, passing along most of the warehouse receipts to the banks as collateral. All this would<br/>have been well and good if it had not developed later that many of the warehouse receipts were<br/>forged, that much of the oil they attested to was not, and probably never had been, in Bayonne, and<br/>that Allied’s president, Anthony De Angelis (who was later sent to jail on a whole parcel of charges),<br/>had apparently pulled off the biggest commercial fraud since that of Ivar Kreuger, the match king.</span></a><a name="bookmark197">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Where was the missing oil? How could Allied’s direct and indirect creditors, including some of<br/>the most powerful and worldly-wise banks of the United States and Great Britain, have been so<br/>thoroughly gulled? Would aggregate losses on the whole debacle finally total a hundred and fifty<br/>million dollars, as some authorities had estimated, or would the bill be even bigger? How could a<br/>leading Stock Exchange firm like Haupt have been so foolish as to take on such an inconceivably<br/>risky commitment for a single customer? These questions had not even been raised, let alone<br/>answered, on November 19th; some of them have not been answered yet, and some of them may not<br/>be answered for years. What began to emerge on November 19th, and what became clear in the<br/>harrowing days that followed, was that in the case of Haupt, which had about twenty thousand<br/>individual stock-market customers on its books, and in the case of Williston &amp; Beane, which had<br/>about nine thousand, the impending disaster directly involved the personal savings of many totally<br/>innocent persons who had never heard of Allied and had only the vaguest notion of what commodity<br/>trading is.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark198"><span class="s6">KAMERMAN’S </span></a><span>report to the Stock Exchange did not mean that Haupt had gone broke, and at the time he<br/>made it Kamerman himself surely did not think that his firm </span><i>had </i><span>gone broke; there is a great<br/>difference between insolvency and a mere failure to meet the Exchange’s rather stringent capital<br/>requirements, which are intended to provide a margin of safety. Indeed, various Stock Exchange<br/>officials have said that on that Tuesday morning they did not consider the Haupt situation to be<br/>especially serious, while the Williston &amp; Beane situation, it was clear from the first, was even less<br/>so. One of the first reactions in the member-firms department was chagrin that Kamerman had come to<br/>the Exchange with his problem before the Exchange, through its elaborate system of audits and<br/>examinations, had discovered the problem for itself. This, the Exchange insists stubbornly, if a bit</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>lamely, was a matter of bad luck rather than bad management. As a matter of routine, the Exchange<br/>required each of its member firms to fill out detailed questionnaires on its financial condition several<br/>times a year, and as an additional check an expert accountant from the Exchange staff descended<br/>unexpectedly on each member firm at least once a year to subject its books to a surprise inspection.<br/>Ira Haupt &amp; Co. had filled out its most recent questionnaire early in October, and since the huge<br/>buildup in Allied’s commodities position with Haupt took place after that, the questionnaire showed<br/>nothing amiss. As for the surprise inspection, the Exchange’s man was in the Haupt offices conducting<br/>it at the very time the trouble broke. The auditor had been there for a week, his nose buried in Haupt’s<br/>account books, but the task of conducting such an inspection is a tedious one, and by November 19th<br/>the auditor hadn’t got around to examining the Haupt commodities department. “They had set our man<br/>up with a desk in a department where nothing unusual was going on,” an Exchange official has since<br/>said. “It’s easy to say now that he should have </span><i>smelled </i>trouble, but he didn’t.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At midmorning on Tuesday the nineteenth, Coyle and Bishop sat down with Kamerman to see what<br/>needed to be done about Haupt’s problem, and what could be done. Bishop remembers that the<br/>atmosphere of the meeting was by no means grim; according to Kamerman’s figures, the amount of<br/>capital that Haupt needed to bring it up to snuff was about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars—an<br/>almost paltry sum for a firm of Haupt’s size. Haupt could make up the deficiency either by obtaining<br/>new money from outside or by converting securities it owned into cash. Bishop urged the latter course<br/>as the quicker and surer, whereupon Kamerman telephoned his firm and instructed his partners to<br/>begin selling some of their securities at once. The difficulty apparently was going to be solved as<br/>simply as that.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark199"><span>But during the rest of the day, after Kamerman had left 11 Wall, the crisis showed a tendency to go<br/>through the process that in political circles had come to be called escalation. In the late afternoon, an<br/>ominous piece of news arrived. Allied had just filed a voluntary-bankruptcy petition in Newark.<br/>Theoretically, the bankruptcy did not affect the financial position of its former brokers, since they<br/>held security for the money they had supplied Allied with; nevertheless, the news was alarming in that<br/>it provided a hint of worse news to follow. Such news, indeed, was not long in coming; the same<br/>evening, word reached the Stock Exchange that the managers of the New York Produce Exchange, in<br/>an effort to forestall chaos in their market, had voted to suspend all trading in cottonseed-oil futures<br/>until further notice, and to require immediate settlement of all outstanding contracts at a price dictated<br/>by them. Since the dictated price would have to be a low one, this meant that any remaining chance<br/>that Haupt or Williston &amp; Beane had of getting out from under the Allied speculations on favorable<br/>terms was gone.</span></a><a name="bookmark200">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In the member-firms department that evening, Bishop was frantically trying to get in touch with G.<br/>Keith Funston, the president of the Stock Exchange, who was first at a midtown dinner and then on a<br/>train bound for Washington, where he was scheduled to testify the next day before a congressional<br/>committee. What with one thing and another, Bishop was busy in his office all evening; toward<br/>midnight, he found himself the last man in the member-firms department, and, having decided it was<br/>too late to go home to Fanwood, New Jersey, for the night, he collapsed on a leather couch in Coyle’s<br/>office. He had a restless night there; the cleaning women were considerately quiet, he said afterward,<br/>but the phones kept ringing all night long.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Promptly at nine-thirty on Wednesday morning, the Stock Exchange’s board of governors met in the<br/>sixth-floor Governors’ Room—which, with its regal red carpet, fierce old portraits, and fluted gilt<br/>columns, carries rather uncomfortable connotations of Wall Street’s checkered past—and, in<br/>accordance with Exchange regulations, voted to suspend Haupt and Williston &amp; Beane because of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark201"><span>their capital difficulties. The suspension was made public a few minutes after trading opened, at ten<br/>o’clock, by Henry M. Watts, Jr., chairman of the board of governors, who ascended a rostrum that<br/>overlooks the trading floor, rang the bell that normally signals the beginning or ending of a day’s<br/>trading, and read an announcement of it. From the point of view of the public, the immediate effect of<br/>the action was that the accounts of the almost thirty thousand customers of the two suspended firms<br/>were now frozen—that is, the owners of the accounts could neither sell their stocks nor get their<br/>money out. Touched by the plight of these unfortunates, the Stock Exchange brass now set about trying<br/>to help the beleaguered firms raise enough capital to lift the suspensions and free the accounts. In the<br/>case of Williston &amp; Beane, its efforts were triumphantly successful. It developed that this firm needed<br/>about half a million dollars to get back into business, and so many fellow-brokers came forward to<br/>help out with loans that the firm actually had to fight off unwanted offers. The half million was finally<br/>accepted partly from Walston &amp; Co. and partly from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith. (Cozily,<br/>the Beane of Williston &amp; Beane was the very man who had been the caboose when the firm’s name<br/>was Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane.) Restored to financial health by this timely injection of<br/>capital, Williston &amp; Beane was relieved of its suspension—and its nine thousand customers were<br/>relieved of their anxiety—just  after noon on Friday, or slightly more than two days after the<br/>suspension had been imposed.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark202"><span>But in the case of Haupt things went differently. It was clear by Wednesday that the capital-<br/>shortage figure of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars had been the rosiest of dreams. Even so, it<br/>appeared that the firm might still be solvent despite its losses on the forced sale of the oil contracts—<br/>on one condition. The condition was that the oil in Bayonne tanks that Allied had pledged to Haupt as<br/>collateral—and that now, through Allied’s default, belonged to Haupt—could be sold to other oil<br/>processors at a fair price. Richard M. Crooks, an Exchange governor who, unlike nearly all his<br/>colleagues, was an expert on commodities trading, figured that if the Bayonne oil were thus unloaded,<br/>Haupt might still end up slightly in the black. He therefore telephoned a couple of the country’s<br/>leading vegetable-oil processors and urged them to bid on the oil. The replies he received were<br/>unanimous and startling. The leading processors declined to make any bid at all, and they left Crooks<br/>with the feeling that they were suspicious of the Bayonne warehouse receipts held by Haupt—that<br/>they suspected some or all of them to be forgeries. If these suspicions were well founded, it would<br/>follow that some or all of the oil attested to by the receipts was not in Bayonne. “The situation was<br/>very simple,” Crooks has said. “Warehouse receipts are accepted in the commodities business as<br/>practically as good as currency, and now the possibility had been raised that millions of dollars of<br/>Haupt’s assets consisted of counterfeit money.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>Still, all that Crooks knew definitely on Wednesday morning was that the processors would not bid<br/>on Allied oil, and throughout the rest of Wednesday and all day Thursday the Exchange furiously went<br/>on trying to help Haupt get back on its feet along with Williston &amp; Beane. Needless to say, the fifteen<br/>partners of Haupt were busy at the same endeavor, and in aid of it Kamerman told the </span><i>Times</i><span>buoyantly on Wednesday evening, “Ira Haupt &amp; Co. is solvent and is in an excellent financial<br/>position.” Also on Wednesday evening, Crooks had dinner in New York with a veteran commodities<br/>broker from Chicago. “Although I’m an optimist by temperament, my experience tells me that these<br/>things always turn out to be much worse than they look at first,” Crooks said recently. “I mentioned<br/>this to my broker friend, and he agreed. The next morning at about eleven-thirty, he called me and<br/>said, ‘Dick, this thing is a hundred per cent worse than even </span><i>you </i><span>think.’” A bit later, at midday on<br/>Thursday, the Exchange’s member-firms department learned that many of Allied’s warehouse receipts<br/>were indeed fake.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark203"><span>As nearly as can be determined, the Haupt partners were making the same unhappy discovery at<br/>about the same time. At any rate, a number of them did not go home Thursday evening but spent the<br/>night at their offices at 111 Broadway, trying to figure out what their position was. Bishop got home<br/>to Fanwood that night, but he found that he could sleep hardly any better there than on Coyle’s couch.<br/>Accordingly, he rose before dawn, took the Jersey Central’s five-eight to the city, and on a hunch<br/>went to the Haupt offices. There, in the partners’ area—recently redecorated with modern contour<br/>chairs, marble-topped filing cabinets, and refrigerators disguised as desks—he found several of the<br/>partners, unshaven and unkempt, drowsing in their chairs. “They were pretty shot by then,” Bishop<br/>said later. And no wonder. After being awakened, they told him that they had been up all night<br/>calculating, and that at about three o’clock they had come to the conclusion that their position was<br/>hopeless; in view of the worthlessness of the warehouse receipts, the Haupt firm was insolvent.<br/>Bishop took this disastrous intelligence with him to the Stock Exchange, where he waited for the sun<br/>to come up and for everyone else to come to work.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AT <span class="p">one-forty on Friday afternoon, when the stock market was already badly rattled by the rumors of<br/>Haupt’s impending failure, the first reports of the President’s assassination reached the Exchange<br/>floor, in garbled form. Crooks, who was there, says that the first thing he heard was that the President<br/>had been shot, the second was that the President’s brother, the Attorney General, had also been shot,<br/>and the third was that the Vice-President had had a heart attack. “The rumors came like machine-gun<br/>bullets,” Crooks says. And they struck with comparable impact. In the next twenty-seven minutes,<br/>during which no hard news arrived to relieve the atmosphere of apocalypse, the prices of stocks<br/>declined at a rate unparalleled in the Exchange’s history. In less than half an hour, the values of listed<br/>stocks decreased by thirteen billion dollars, and they would no doubt have dropped further if the<br/>board of governors had not closed the market for the day at seven minutes past two. The panic’s<br/>immediate effect on the Haupt situation was to make the status of the twenty thousand frozen accounts<br/>far worse, because now, in the event of Haupt’s bankruptcy and the consequent liquidation of many of<br/>the accounts, the cashing in would have to be done at panic prices, with heavy losses to the accounts’<br/>owners. A larger and less calculable effect of the events in Dallas was paralyzing despair. However,<br/>Wall Street—or, rather, some Wall Streeters—had a psychological advantage over the rest of the<br/>country in that there was work at hand to be done. This convergence of disasters confronted them with<br/>a definable task.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark204"><span>Having testified in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, Funston had returned to New York that<br/>evening and had spent most of Thursday as well as Friday morning working on getting Williston &amp;<br/>Beane back in business. Sometime during that period, as it was gradually made clear that Haupt was<br/>not merely short of capital but actually insolvent, Funston became convinced the Exchange and its<br/>member firms must consider doing something virtually unprecedented—that is, reimburse the innocent<br/>victims of Haupt’s imprudence with their own money. (The nearest thing to a precedent for such<br/>action was the case of DuPont, Homsey &amp; Co., a small Stock Exchange firm that went bankrupt in<br/>1960 as a result of fraud by one of its partners; the Exchange then repaid the firm’s customers the<br/>money they had been divested of—about eight hundred thousand dollars.) Now, having hurried back<br/>to his office from a lunch date shortly before the emergency closing of the market, Funston set about<br/>putting his plan into action, calling about thirty leading brokers whose offices happened to be nearby<br/>and asking them to trot over to the Exchange immediately as an unofficial delegation representing its<br/>membership. Shortly after three o’clock, the brokers were assembled in the South Committee Room—<br/>a somewhat smaller version of the Governors’ Room—and Funston set before them the facts of the</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark205"><span>Haupt case as he then knew them, along with an outline of his plan for a solution. The facts were<br/>these: Haupt owed about thirty-six million dollars to a group of United States and British banks; since<br/>over twenty million of its assets were represented by warehouse receipts that now appeared to be<br/>worthless, there was no hope that Haupt could pay its debts. In the normal course of events, therefore,<br/>Haupt would be sued by the creditor banks when the courts reopened next week, the cash and many of<br/>the securities held by Haupt for its customers would be tied up by the creditors, and, according to<br/>Funston’s liberal estimate, some of the customers might end up getting back—after an extended period<br/>caused by legal delays—no more than sixty-five cents on the dollar. And there was another side to the<br/>case. If Haupt were to go into bankruptcy, the psychological effect of this, combined with the<br/>palpable effect of Haupt’s considerable assets’ being thrown on the market, might well lead to further<br/>depression of a stock market already in wild retreat at a time of grave national crisis. Not only the<br/>welfare of the Haupt customers was at stake, then, but perhaps the national welfare, too. Funston’s<br/>plan, simple enough in outline, was that the Stock Exchange or its members put up enough money to<br/>enable all the Haupt customers to get back their cash and securities—to be once again “whole,” in the<br/>banking expression. (The banking expression is etymologically sound; “whole” derives from the<br/>Anglo-Saxon </span></a><i>“hal,” </i><span>which meant uninjured or recovered from injury, and from which “hale” is also<br/>derived.) Funston further proposed that Haupt’s creditors, the banks, be persuaded to defer any efforts<br/>to collect their money until the customers had been taken care of. Funston estimated that the amount<br/>needed to do the job might run to seven million dollars, or even more.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Almost to a man, the assembled brokers agreed to support this public-spirited, if not downright<br/>eleemosynary, plan. But before the meeting was over a difficulty arose. Now that the Stock Exchange<br/>and the member firms had decided on a deed of self-sacrifice, the problem confronting each side—to<br/>a certain extent, anyway—was how to arrange to have the other side do the sacrificing. Funston urged<br/>the member firms to take over the entire matter. The firms declined this suggestion with thanks and<br/>countered by urging the Stock Exchange to handle it. “If we do,” Funston said, “you’ll have to repay<br/>us the amount we pay out.” Out of this not very dignified dialogue emerged an agreement that initially<br/>the funds would come out of the Exchange’s treasury, with repayment to be apportioned among the<br/>member firms later. A  three-man committee, headed by Funston, was empowered to conduct<br/>negotiations to bring the deal off.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark206"><span>The chief parties that needed negotiating with were Haupt’s creditor banks. Their unanimous<br/>consentto the plan was essential, because if even one of them insisted on immediate liquidation of its<br/>loans “the pot would fall in,” as the Exchange’s chairman, Henry Watts—a fatherly-looking graduate<br/>of Harvard and of Omaha Beach, 1944—pungently put it. Prominent among the creditors were four<br/>local banks of towering prestige—Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty Trust, First National City, and<br/>Manufacturers Hanover Trust—which among them had lent Haupt about eighteen and a half million<br/>dollars. (Three of the banks have remained notably reticent about the exact amount of their ill-fated<br/>loans to Haupt, but blaming them for their silence would be like blaming a poker player who is less<br/>than garrulous about a losing night. The Chase, however, has said that Haupt owed it $5,700,000.)<br/>Earlier in the week, George Champion, chairman of the Chase, had telephoned Funston; not only did<br/>the Stock Exchange have a friend at Chase, Champion assured him, but the bank stood ready to give<br/>any help it could in the Haupt matter. Funston now called Champion and said he was ready to take<br/>him up on his offer. He and Bishop then began to try to assemble representatives of the Chase and the<br/>three other banks for an immediate conference. Bishop remembers that he felt highly bearish about the<br/>chances of rounding up a group of bankers at five o’clock on a Friday—even such an exceptional<br/>Friday as this one—but to his surprise he found practically all of them at their battle stations and</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">willing to come straight to the Exchange.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Funston and his fellow-negotiators for the Exchange—Chairman Watts and Vice-Chairman Walter</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>N. Frank—conferred with the bankers from shortly after five until well into the dinner hour. The<br/>meeting was constructive, if tense. “First, we all agreed that it was a devil of a situation all around,”<br/>Funston subsequently recalled. “Then we got down to business. The bankers, of course, were hoping<br/>that the Exchange would pick up the whole thing, but we quickly disabused them of that notion.<br/>Instead, I made them an offer. We would put up a certain sum in cash solely for the benefit of the<br/>Haupt customers; in exchange for every dollar that we put up, the banks would defer collection—that<br/>is, would temporarily refrain from foreclosing—on two dollars. If, as we then estimated, twenty-two<br/>and a half million was needed to make Haupt solvent, we would put up seven and a half, and the<br/>banks would defer collection of fifteen. They weren’t so sure about our figures—they thought we<br/>were too low—and they insisted that the Exchange’s claim to get back any of its contribution out of<br/>Haupt assets would have to come after the banks’ claims for their loans. We agreed to that. We all<br/>fought and negotiated, and when we finally went home there was general agreement on the broad<br/>outline of the thing. Of course, everyone recognized that this meeting was only preliminary—to begin<br/>with, by no means all the creditor banks were represented at it—and that both the detail work and<br/>much of the hard bargaining would have to be done over the weekend.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Just how much detail work and hard bargaining lay ahead became manifest on Saturday. The<br/>Exchange’s board met at eleven, and more than two-thirds of its thirty-three members were present;<br/>because of the Haupt crisis, some governors had cancelled weekend plans, and others had flown in<br/>from their regular stands in such outposts as Georgia and Florida. The board’s first action—a<br/>decision to keep the Exchange closed on Monday, the day of the President’s funeral—was<br/>accomplished with deep relief, because the holiday would give the negotiators an additional twenty-<br/>four hours in which to hammer out a deal before the deadline represented by the reopening of the<br/>courts and the markets. Funston brought the governors up to date on what was known about Haupt’s<br/>financial position and on the status of the negotiations that had been begun with the banks; he also<br/>gave them a new estimate of the sum that might be required to make the Haupt customers whole—nine<br/>million dollars. After a fractional moment of silence, several governors rose to say, in essence, that<br/>they felt that more than money was at stake; it was a question of the relation of the Stock Exchange to<br/>the country’s many million investors. The meeting was then temporarily adjourned, and, with the<br/>authority of the governors’ lofty sentiments to back it up, the Exchange’s three-man committee got<br/>down to negotiations with the bankers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark207"><span>Thus, the pattern for Saturday and Sunday was set. While the rest of the nation sat stupefied in front<br/>of its television sets, and while the downtown Manhattan streets were as deserted as they must have<br/>been during the yellow-fever epidemics of the early nineteenth century, the sixth floor of 11 Wall<br/>Street was a nexus of utterly absorbed activity. The Exchange’s committee would remain closeted<br/>with the bankers until a point was reached at which Funston and his colleagues needed further<br/>authorization; then the board of governors would go into session again and either grant the new<br/>authority or decline to do so. Between sessions, the governors congregated in the hallways or smoked<br/>and brooded in empty offices. An ordinarily obscure corner of the Exchange bureaucracy called the<br/>Conduct and Complaints Department was having a busy weekend, too; a staff of half a dozen there<br/>was continuously on the phone dealing with anxious inquiries from Haupt customers, who were<br/>feeling anything but hale. And, of course, there were lawyers everywhere—“I never saw so many<br/>lawyers in my life,” one veteran Stock Exchange man has said. Coyle estimates that there were more<br/>than a hundred people at 11 Wall Street during most of the weekend, and since practically all local</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>restaurants as well as the Exchange’s own eating facilities were closed, the food problem was acute.<br/>On  Saturday, the entire output of a downtown lunch counter that had shrewdly stayed open was bought<br/>up and consumed, after which a taxi was dispatched to Greenwich Village for more supplies; on<br/>Sunday, one of the Exchange secretaries thoughtfully brought in an electric coffee-maker and a huge<br/>bag of groceries and set up shop in the Chairman’s Dining Room.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark208"><span>The bankers’ negotiating committee now included men from two Haupt creditors that had not been<br/>represented on Friday—the National State Bank of Newark and the Continental Illinois National Bank<br/>&amp;  Trust Co., of Chicago. (Still unrepresented were the four British creditors—Henry Ansbacher &amp;<br/>Co.; William Brandt’s Sons &amp; Co., Ltd.; S. Japhet &amp; Co., Ltd.; and Kleinwort, Benson, Ltd.<br/>Moreover, with the weekend half gone, they seemed to be temporarily unrepresentable. It was<br/>decided to continue negotiating without the British banks and then, on Monday morning, present any<br/>agreement to them for approval.) A crucial point at issue, it now developed, was the amount of cash<br/>that would be needed from the Stock Exchange to fulfill its part of the bargain. The bankers accepted<br/>Funston’s formula under which they would defer collection of two dollars for every dollar that the<br/>Exchange contributed to the cause, and they did not doubt that Haupt was stuck with about twenty-two<br/>and a half million dollars’ worth of useless warehouse receipts; however, they were unwilling to take<br/>that figure as the maximum amount that might be necessary to liquidate Haupt. To be on the safe side,<br/>they argued, the amount ought to be based on Haupt’s over-all indebtedness to them—thirty-six<br/>million—and this meant that the Exchange’s cash contribution would have to be not seven and a half<br/>million but twelve. Another point at issue was the question of to whom the Exchange would pay<br/>whatever sum was agreed upon. Some of the bankers thought the money ought to go straight into the<br/>coffers of Ira Haupt &amp; Co., to be dispensed by the firm itself to its customers; the trouble with this<br/>suggestion, as the Exchange’s representatives were not slow to point out, was that it would put the<br/>Exchange’s contribution entirely beyond its control. As a final complication, one bank—the<br/>Continental Illinois—was distinctly reluctant to enter into the deal at all. “The Continental’s people<br/>were thinking in terms of their bank’s exposure,” an Exchange man has explained sympathetically.<br/>“They thought our arrangement might ultimately be more damaging to them than a formal Haupt<br/>bankruptcy and receivership. They needed time to consider, to make sure they were taking the proper<br/>action, but I must say they were coöperative.” Indeed, since it was primarily the Stock Exchange’s<br/>good name that was at the center of the planned deal, it would appear that all the banks were marvels<br/>of coöperation. After all, a banker is legally and morally charged with doing the best he can for his<br/>depositors and stockholders, and is therefore hardly in a position to indulge in grand gestures for the<br/>public good; if his eyes are flinty, they may mask a kind, but stifled, heart. As for the Continental, it<br/>had reason to be particularly slow to act, because its “exposure” amounted to well over ten million<br/>dollars, or much more than that of any other bank. No one concerned has been willing to say exactly<br/>what the points were on which the Continental held out, but it seems safe to assume that no bank or<br/>person who had lent Haupt less than ten million dollars can know exactly how the Continental felt.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>By the time the negotiations were recessed, at about six o’clock Saturday evening, a compromise<br/>had been reached on the main issues—on the amount-of-cash controversy by an agreement that the<br/>Exchange would put up an initial seven and a half million with a pledge to go up to twelve million if<br/>it became necessary, and on the controversy about how the money would be paid to the Haupt<br/>customers by agreement that the Exchange’s chief examiner would be appointed liquidator of Haupt.<br/>But the Continental was still recalcitrant, and, of course, the British banks had not yet even been<br/>approached. In any event, everybody shut up shop for the night, with pledges to return early the next<br/>afternoon, even though it was Sunday. Funston, who was coming down with a bad cold, went home to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Greenwich. The bankers went home to places like Glen Cove and Basking Ridge. Watts, a diehard<br/>commuter from Philadelphia, went home to that tranquil city. Even Bishop went home to Fanwood.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At two o’clock Sunday afternoon, the Exchange governors, their ranks now augmented by arrivals<br/>from Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Richmond, met in joint session with the thirty<br/>representatives of member firms, who were anxious to learn what they were being committed to.<br/>After the current status of the emerging agreement had been explained to them, they voted unanimously<br/>in favor of going ahead with it. As the afternoon progressed, even Continental Illinois softened its<br/>opposition, and at about six o’clock, after a series of frantic long-distance telephone calls and<br/>attempts to track down Continental officers on trains and in airports, the Chicago bank agreed to go<br/>along, explaining that it was doing so in the public interest rather than in pursuance of its officers’<br/>best business judgment. At about the same time, the </span><i>Times’ </i><span>financial editor, Thomas E. Mullaney—<br/>who, like the rest of the press, had been rigidly excluded from the sixth floor throughout the<br/>negotiations—called Funston to say he had heard rumors of a plan on Haupt in the offing. Because the<br/>British banks would have reason to be miffed, at the very least, if they should read in the next<br/>morning’s air editions of a scheme to dispose of their credits without their agreement, or even their<br/>knowledge, Funston had to give a reply that could only depress still further the spirits of the waiting<br/>twenty thousand customers. “There is no plan,” he said.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark209"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>question of who would undertake the delicate task of cajoling the British banks had come up<br/>early Sunday afternoon. Funston, despite his cold, was anxious to make the trip (for one thing, he has<br/>since admitted, the drama of it appealed to him), and had gone as far as getting his secretary to<br/>reserve space on a plane, but as the afternoon progressed and the local problems continued to appear<br/>intractable, it was decided that he couldn’t be spared. Several other governors quickly volunteered to<br/>go,     and one of them, Gustave L. Levy, was eventually selected, on the ground that his firm, Goldman,<br/>Sachs &amp; Co., had had a long and close association with Kleinwort, Benson, one of the British banks,<br/>and that Levy himself was on excellent terms with some of the Kleinwort, Benson partners. (Levy<br/>would later succeed Watts as chairman.) Accordingly, Levy, accompanied by an executive and a<br/>lawyer of the Chase—who were presumably included in the hope that they would set the British<br/>banks an inspiring example of coöperation—left 11 Wall Street shortly after five o’clock and caught a<br/>London-bound jet at seven. The trio sat up on the plane most of the night, carefully planning the<br/>approach they would make to the bankers in the morning. They were well advised to do so, because<br/>the British banks certainly had no cause to feel coöperative; </span><i>their </i><span>Stock Exchange wasn’t in trouble.<br/>And there was more to it than that. According to unimpeachable sources, the four British banks had<br/>lent Haupt a total of five and a half million dollars, and these loans, like many short-term loans made<br/>by foreign banks to American brokers, had not been secured by any collateral. Sources only<br/>fractionally more impeachable maintain that some of the loans had been extended very recently—that<br/>is,          a week or less before the debacle. The money lent is known to have consisted of Eurodollars, a<br/>phantom but nonetheless serviceable currency consisting of dollar deposits in European banks; some<br/>four billion Eurodollars were actively traded among European financial institutions at that time, and<br/>the banks that lent the five and a half million to Haupt had first borrowed them from somebody else.<br/>According to a local expert in international banking, Eurodollars are customarily traded in huge<br/>blocks at a relatively tiny profit; for instance, a bank might borrow a block at four and a quarter per<br/>cent and lend it at four and a half per cent, at a net advantage of one fourth of one per cent per annum.<br/>Obviously, such transactions are looked upon as practically without risk. One-fourth of one per cent<br/>of five and a half million dollars over a period of one week amounts to $264.42, which gives some</span><a name="bookmark210">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark211">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>indication of the size of the profit on the Haupt deal that the four British banks would have been able<br/>to  divide among themselves, less expenses, if everything had gone as planned. Instead, they now<br/>stood to lose the whole bundle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Levy and the Chase men arrived red-eyed in London shortly after daybreak on a depressingly<br/>drizzly morning. They went to the Savoy to change their clothes and have breakfast and then headed<br/>straight for the City, London’s financial district. Their first meeting was at the Fenchurch Street<br/>establishment of William Brandt’s Sons, which had put up over half of the five and a half million. The<br/>Brandt partners courteously offered condolences on the death of the President, and the Americans<br/>agreed that it was a terrible thing, whereupon both sides came to the point. The Brandt men knew of<br/>Haupt’s impending failure but not of the plan now afoot to rescue the Haupt customers by avoiding a<br/>formal bankruptcy; Levy explained this, and an hour’s discussion followed, in the course of which the<br/>Britons showed a certain reluctance to go along—as well they might. Having just been taken in by one<br/>group of Yankees, they were not anxious to be immediately taken in by another. “They were very<br/>unhappy,” Levy says. “They raised hell with me as a representative of the New York Stock Exchange,<br/>one of whose members had got them into this jam. They wanted to make a trade with us—to get a<br/>priority in the collection of their claims in exchange for coming along with us and agreeing to defer<br/>collection. But their trading position wasn’t really good; in a bankruptcy proceeding, their claims,<br/>based on unsecured loans, would have been considered </span><i>after </i><span>the claims of creditors who held<br/>collateral, and in my opinion they would have never collected a nickel. On the other hand, under the<br/>terms of our offer they would be treated equally with all the other Haupt creditors except the<br/>customers. We had to explain to them that we weren’t trading.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark212"><span>The Brandt men replied that before deciding they wanted to think the matter over, and also to hear<br/>what the other British banks said. The American delegates then repaired to the London office of the<br/>Chase, on Lombard Street, where, by prearrangement, they met with representatives of the three other<br/>British banks and Levy had a chance for a reunion with his Kleinwort, Benson friends. The<br/>circumstances of the reunion were obviously less than happy, but Levy says that his friends took a<br/>realistic view of their situation and, with heroic objectivity, actually helped their fellow-Britons to<br/>see the American side of the question. Nevertheless, this meeting, like the earlier one, broke up<br/>without commitment by anyone. Levy and his colleagues stayed at the Chase for lunch and then<br/>walked over to the Bank of England, which was interested in the Haupt loans to the extent that their<br/>default would affect Britain’s balance of payments. The Bank of England, through one of its deputies,<br/>assured the visitors of its distress over both America’s national tragedy and Wall Street’s parochial<br/>one, and advised them that while it lacked the power to tell the London banks what to do, in its<br/>judgment they would be wise to go along with the American scheme. Then, at about two o’clock, the<br/>trio returned to Lombard Street to wait nervously for word from the banks. As it happened, a parallel<br/>vigil was then beginning on Wall Street, where it was nine o’clock on Monday morning, and where<br/>Funston, just arrived in his office and very much aware that only one day remained in which to get the<br/>deal wrapped up, was pacing his rug as he waited for a call that would tell him whether London was<br/>going to cause the pot to fall in.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Kleinwort, Benson and S. Japhet &amp; Co. were the first to agree to go along, Levy recalls. Then—<br/>after a silence of perhaps half an hour, during which Levy and his colleagues began to have an<br/>agonizing sense of the minutes ticking away in New York—an affirmative answer came from Brandt.<br/>That was the big one; with the chief creditor and two of the three others in line, it was all but certain<br/>that Ansbacher would join up. At around 4 </span><span class="s6">P.M. </span><span>London time, Ansbacher did, and Levy was finally<br/>able to place the call that Funston had been waiting for. Their mission accomplished, the Americans</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">went straight to the London airport, and within three hours were on a plane headed home.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark213"><span>On getting the good news, Funston felt that the whole agreement was pretty well in the bag at last,<br/>since all that was needed to seal the bag was the signatures of the fifteen Haupt general partners, who<br/>seemed to have nothing to lose and everything to gain from the plan. Still, the task of getting those<br/>signatures was a vital one. Short of a bankruptcy suit, which everyone was trying to avoid, no<br/>liquidator could distribute the Haupt assets—not even the marble-topped cabinets and the<br/>refrigerators—without the partners’ permission. Accordingly, late on Monday afternoon the Haupt<br/>partners, each accompanied by his lawyer, trooped into Chairman Watts’s office at  the Stock<br/>Exchange to learn exactly what fate the Wall Street powers had been arranging for them.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark214"><span>The Haupt partners could hardly have found the projected agreement pleasant reading, inasmuch as<br/>it prescribed, among other things, that they were to execute powers of attorney giving a liquidator full<br/>controlover Haupt’s affairs. However, one of their own lawyers gave them a short, pungent talk<br/>pointing out that they were personally liable for the firm’s debts whether or not they signed the<br/>agreement, so they might as well be public-spirited and sign it. More briefly, they were over a barrel.<br/>(Many of them later filed personal bankruptcy papers.) One startling event broke the even tenor of this<br/>gloomy meeting. Shortly after the Haupt lawyer had wound up his disquisition on the facts of life,<br/>someone noticed an unfamiliar and strikingly youthful face in the crowd and asked its owner to<br/>identify himself. The unhesitating reply was “I’m Russell Watson, a reporter for the </span></a><i>Wall Street</i><span>.” There was a short, stunned silence, in recognition of the fact that an untimely leak might<br/>still disturb the delicate balance of money and emotion that made up the agreement. Watson himself,<br/>who was twenty-four and had been on the </span><i>Journal </i><span>for a year, has since explained how he got into the<br/>meeting, and under what circumstances he left it. “I was new on the Stock Exchange beat then,” he<br/>said afterward. “Earlier in the day, there had been word that Funston would probably hold a press<br/>conference sometime that evening, so I went over to the Exchange. At the main entrance, I asked a<br/>guard where Mr. Funston’s conference was. The guard said it was on the sixth floor, and ushered me<br/>into an elevator. I suppose he thought I was a banker, a Haupt partner, or a lawyer. On the sixth floor,<br/>people were milling around everywhere. I just walked off the elevator and into the office where the<br/>meeting was—nobody stopped me. I didn’t understand much of what was going on. I got the feeling<br/>that whatever was at stake, there was general agreement but still a lot of haggling over details to be<br/>done. I didn’t recognize anybody there but Funston. I stood around quietly for about five minutes<br/>before anybody noticed me, and then everybody said, pretty much at once, ‘Good God, get out of<br/>here!’ They didn’t exactly </span><i>kick </i>me out, but I saw it was time to go.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>During the haggling phase that followed—a painfully protracted one, it developed—the Haupt<br/>partners and their lawyers made a command post of Watts’s office, while the bank representatives<br/>and </span><i>their </i><span>lawyers camped in the North Committee Room, just down the hall. Funston, who was<br/>determined that news of a settlement should be in the hands of investors before the opening of the<br/>market next morning, was going wild with irritation and frustration, and in an effort to speed things up<br/>he constituted himself a sort of combination messenger boy and envoy. “All Monday evening, I kept<br/>running back and forth saying, ‘Look, they won’t give in on this point, so you’ve got to,’” he recalls.<br/>“Or I’d say, ‘Look what time it is—only twelve hours until tomorrow’s market opening! Initial<br/>here.’”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At fifteen minutes past midnight, nine and three-quarters hours before the market’s reopening, the<br/>agreement was signed in the South Committee Room by the twenty-eight parties at interest, in an<br/>atmosphere that a participant has described as one of exhaustion and general relief. As soon as the<br/>banks opened on Tuesday morning, the Stock Exchange deposited seven and a half million dollars, a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark215"><span>sum amounting to roughly one-third of its available reserve, in an account on which the Haupt<br/>liquidator could draw; the same morning, the liquidator himself—James P. Mahony, a veteran<br/>member of the Exchange’s staff—moved into the Haupt offices to take charge. The stock market,<br/>encouraged by confidence in the new President or by news of  the Haupt settlement, or by a<br/>combination of the two, had its greatest one-day rise in history, more than eliminating Friday’s losses.<br/>A week later, on December 2nd, Mahony announced that $1,750,000, had already been paid out of the<br/>Stock Exchange  account to bail out Haupt customers; by December 12th, the figure  was up to</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$5,400,000, and by Christmas to $6,700,000. Finally, on March 11, 1964, the Exchange was able to<br/>report that it had dispensed nine and a half million dollars, and that the Haupt customers, with the<br/>exception of a handful who couldn’t be found, were whole again.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">THE </span><span>agreement, in which some people saw an unmistakable implication that Wall Street’s<br/>Establishment now felt accountable for public harm caused by the misdeeds, or even the misfortunes,<br/>of any of its members, gave rise to a variety of reactions. The rescued Haupt customers were<br/>predictably grateful, of course. The </span><i>Times </i><span>said that the agreement was evidence of “a sense of<br/>responsibility that served to inspire investor confidence” and “may have helped to avoid a potential<br/>panic.” In Washington, President Johnson interrupted his first business day in office to telephone<br/>Funston and congratulate him. The chairman of the S.E.C., William L. Cary, who was not ordinarily<br/>given to throwing bouquets at the Stock Exchange, said in December that it had furnished “a dramatic,<br/>impressive demonstration of its strength and concern for the public interest.” Other stock exchanges<br/>around the world were silent on the matter, but if one may judge by the unsentimental way that most of<br/>them do business, some of their officials must have been indulging in a certain amount of headshaking<br/>over the strange doings in New York. The Stock Exchange’s member firms, who were assessed for<br/>the nine and a half million dollars over a period of three years, appeared to be generally satisfied,<br/>although a few of them were heard to grumble that fine old firms with justified reputations for skill<br/>and probity should not be asked to pay the losses of greedy upstarts who overstep and get caught out.<br/>Oddly, almost no one seems to have expressed gratitude to the British and American banks, which<br/>recouped something like half of their losses. It may be that people simply don’t thank banks, except in<br/>television commercials.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark216"><span>The Stock Exchange itself, meanwhile, was torn between blushingly accepting congratulations and<br/>prudently, if perhaps gracelessly, insisting that what it had done wasn’t to be regarded as a precedent</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—that it wouldn’t necessarily do the same thing again. Nor were the Exchange’s officials at all sure<br/>that the same thing would have been done if the Haupt case had occurred earlier—even a very little<br/>earlier. Crooks, who was chairman of the Exchange in the early 1950s, felt that the chances of such<br/>action during his term would have been about fifty-fifty. Funston, who assumed his office in 1951, felt<br/>that the matter would have been “questionable” during the early years of his incumbency. “One’s idea<br/>of public responsibility is evolutionary,” he said. He was particularly annoyed by the idea, which he<br/>had heard repeatedly, that the Exchange had acted out of a sense of guilt. Psychoanalytic<br/>interpretations of the event, he felt, were gratuitous, not to say churlish. As for those older governors<br/>who glared, quite possibly balefully, at the negotiations from their gilt frames in the Governors’<br/>Room and the North and South Committee Rooms, their reaction to the whole proceeding may be<br/>imagined but cannot be known.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark217">7</a><a name="bookmark218">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark219">The Impacted Philosophers</a><a name="bookmark220">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark221"><span class="s6">AMONG THE GREATEST </span></a><span>problems facing American industry today, one may learn by talking with any of<br/>a large number of industrialists who are not known to be especially given to pontificating, is “the<br/>problem of communication.” This preoccupation with the difficulty of getting a thought out of one<br/>head and into another is something the industrialists share with a substantial number of intellectuals<br/>and creative writers, more and more of whom seem inclined to regard communication, or the lack of<br/>it, as one of the greatest problems not just of industry but of humanity. (A group of avant-garde writers<br/>and artists have given the importance of communication a backhanded boost by flatly and<br/>unequivocally proclaiming themselves to be </span><i>against </i><span>it.) As far as the industrialists are concerned, I<br/>admit that in the course of hearing them invoke the word “communication”—often in an almost<br/>mystical way—over a period of years I have had a lot of trouble figuring out exactly what they meant.<br/>The general thesis is clear enough; namely, that everything would be all right, first, if they could get<br/>through to each other within their own organizations, and, second, if they, or their organizations, could<br/>get through to everybody else. What has puzzled me is how and why, in this day when the foundations<br/>sponsor one study of communication after another, individuals and organizations fail so consistently<br/>to express themselves understandably, or how and why their listeners fail to grasp what they hear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark222"><span>A few years ago, I acquired a two-volume publication of the United States Government Printing<br/>Office entitled </span></a><i>Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Committee on</i><span>, and after a fairly diligent perusal of its 1,459 pages I thought I could begin to see what the<br/>industrialists are talking about. The hearings, conducted in April, May, and June, 1961, under the<br/>chairmanship of Senator Estes Kefauver, of Tennessee, had to do with the now famous price-fixing<br/>and bid-rigging conspiracies in the electrical-manufacturing industry, which had already resulted, the<br/>previous February, in the imposition by a federal judge in Philadelphia of fines totaling $1,924,500<br/>on twenty-nine firms and forty-five of their employees, and also of thirty-day prison sentences on<br/>seven of the employees. Since there had been no public presentation of evidence, all the defendants<br/>having pleaded either guilty or no defense, and since the records of the grand juries that indicted them<br/>were secret, the public had had little opportunity to hear about the details of the violations, and<br/>Senator Kefauver felt that the whole matter needed a good airing. The transcript shows that it got one,<br/>and what the airing revealed—at least within the biggest company involved—was a breakdown in<br/>intramural communication so drastic as to make the building of the Tower of Babel seem a triumph of<br/>organizational rapport.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In a series of indictments brought by the government in the United States District Court in<br/>Philadelphia between February and October, 1960, the twenty-nine companies and their executives<br/>were charged with having repeatedly violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act of 1890, which declares</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>illegal “every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of<br/>trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.” (The Sherman Act was the<br/>instrument used in the celebrated trust-busting activities of Theodore Roosevelt, and along with the<br/>Clayton Act of 1914 it has served as the government’s weapon against cartels and monopolies ever<br/>since.) The violations, the government alleged, were committed in connection with the sale of large<br/>and expensive pieces of apparatus of a variety that is required chiefly by public and private electric-<br/>utility companies (power transformers, switchgear assemblies, and turbine-generator units, among<br/>many others), and were the outcome of a series of meetings attended by executives of the supposedly<br/>competing companies—beginning at least as early as 1956 and continuing into 1959—at which<br/>noncompetitive price levels were agreed upon, nominally sealed bids on individual contracts were<br/>rigged in advance, and each company was allocated a certain percentage of the available business.<br/>The government further alleged that, in an effort to preserve the secrecy of these meetings, the<br/>executives had resorted to such devices as referring to their companies by code numbers in their<br/>correspondence, making telephone calls from public booths or from their homes rather than from their<br/>offices, and doctoring the expense accounts covering their get-togethers to conceal the fact that they<br/>had all been in a certain city on a certain day. But their stratagems did not prevail. The federals,<br/>forcefully led by Robert A. Bicks, then head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,<br/>succeeded in exposing them, with considerable help from some of the conspirators themselves, who,<br/>after an employee of a small conspirator company saw fit to spill the story in the early fall of 1959,<br/>flocked to turn state’s evidence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark223"><span>The economic and social significance of the whole affair may be demonstrated clearly enough by<br/>citing just a few figures. In an average year at the time of the conspiracies, a total of more than one<br/>and three-quarters billion dollars was spent to purchase machines of the sort in question, nearly a<br/>fourth of it by federal, state, and local governments (which, of course, means the taxpayers), and most<br/>of the rest by private utility companies (which are inclined to pass along any rise in the cost of their<br/>equipment to the public in the form of rate increases). To take a specific example of the kind of money<br/>involved in an individual transaction, the list price of a 500,000-kilowatt turbine-generator—a<br/>monstrous device for producing electric power from steam power—was often something like sixteen<br/>million dollars. Actually, manufacturers sometimes cut their prices by as much as 25 percent in order<br/>to make a sale, and therefore, if everything was above board, it might have been possible to buy the<br/>machine at a saving of four million dollars; if representatives of the companies making such<br/>generators held a single meeting and agreed to fix prices, they could, in effect, increase the cost to the<br/>customer by the four million. And in the end, the customer was almost sure to be the public.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IN <span class="p">presenting the indictments in Philadelphia, Bicks stated that, considered collectively, they revealed<br/>“a pattern of violations which can fairly be said to range among the most serious, the most flagrant,<br/>the most pervasive that have ever marked any basic American industry.” Just before imposing the<br/>sentences,Judge J. Cullen Ganey went even further; in his view, the violations constituted “a<br/>shocking indictment of a vast section of our economy, for what is really at stake here is the survival of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark224"><span>… the free-enterprise system.” The prison sentences showed that he meant it; although there had been<br/>many successful prosecutions for violation of the Sherman Act during the seven decades since its<br/>passage, it was rare indeed for executives to be jailed. Not surprisingly, therefore, the case kicked up<br/>quite a ruckus in the press. The </span></a><i>New Republic</i><span>, to be sure, complained that the newspapers and<br/>magazines were intentionally playing down “the biggest business scandal in decades,” but the charge<br/>did not seem to have much foundation. Considering such things as the public’s apathy toward</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>switchgear, the woeful bloodlessness of criminal cases involving antitrust laws, and the relatively<br/>few details of the conspiracies that had emerged, the press in general gave the story a good deal of<br/>space, and even the </span><i>Wall Street Journal </i>and <i>Fortune </i><span>ran uncompromising and highly informative<br/>accounts of the debacle; here and there, in fact, one could detect signs of a revival of the spirit of old-<br/>time antibusiness journalism as it existed back in the thirties. After all, what could be more<br/>exhilarating than to see several dignified, impeccably tailored, and highly paid executives of a few of<br/>the nation’s most respected corporations being trooped off to jail like common pickpockets? It was<br/>certainly the biggest moment for business-baiters since 1938, when Richard Whitney, the former<br/>president of the New York Stock Exchange, was put behind bars for speculating with his customers’<br/>money. Some called it the biggest since Teapot Dome.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark225"><span>To top it all off, there was a prevalent suspicion of hypocrisy in the very highest places. Neither<br/>the chairman of the board nor the president of General Electric, the largest of the corporate<br/>defendants, had been caught in the government’s dragnet, and the same was true of Westinghouse<br/>Electric, the second-largest; these four ultimate bosses let it be known that they had been entirely<br/>ignorant of what had been going on within their commands right up to the time the first testimony on<br/>the subject was given to the Justice Department. Many people, however, were not satisfied by these<br/>disclaimers, and, instead, took the position that the defendant executives were men in the middle, who<br/>had broken the law only in response either to actual orders or to a corporate climate favoring price-<br/>fixing, and who were now being allowed to suffer for the sins of their superiors. Among the<br/>unsatisfied was Judge Ganey himself, who said at the time of the sentencing, “One would be most<br/>naïve indeed to believe that these violations of the law, so long persisted in, affecting so large a<br/>segment of the industry, and, finally, involving so many millions upon millions of dollars, were facts<br/>unknown to those responsible for the conduct of the corporation.… I am convinced that in the great<br/>number of these defendants’ cases, they were torn between conscience and approved corporate<br/>policy, with the rewarding objectives of promotion, comfortable security, and large salaries.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>The public naturally wanted a ringleader, an archconspirator, and it appeared to find what it<br/>wanted in General Electric, which—to the acute consternation of the men endeavoring to guide its<br/>destinies from company headquarters, at 570 Lexington Avenue, New York City—got the lion’s share<br/>of attention both in the press and in the Subcommittee hearings. With some 300,000 employees, and<br/>sales averaging some four billion dollars a year over the past ten years, it was not only far and away<br/>the biggest of the twenty-nine accused companies but, judged on the basis of sales in 1959, the fifth-<br/>biggest company in the country. It also drew a higher total of fines ($437,500) than any other<br/>company, and saw more of its executives sent to jail (three, with eight others receiving suspended<br/>sentences). Furthermore, as if to intensify in this hour of crisis the horror and shock of true believers</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—and the glee of scoffers—its highest-ranking executives had for years tried to represent it to the<br/>public as a paragon of successful virtue by issuing encomiums to the free competitive system, the very<br/>system that the price-fixing meetings were set up to mock. In 1959, shortly after the government’s<br/>investigation of the violations had been brought to the attention of G.E.’s policymakers, the company<br/>demoted and cut the pay of those of its executives who admitted that they had been involved; one<br/>vice-president, for example, was informed that instead of the $127,000 a year he had been getting he<br/>would now get $40,000. (He had scarcely adjusted himself to that blow when Judge Ganey fined him<br/>four thousand dollars and sent him to prison for thirty days, and shortly after he regained his freedom,<br/>General Electric eased him out entirely.) The G.E. policy of imposing penalties of its own on these<br/>employees, regardless of what punishment the court might prescribe, was not adopted by<br/>Westinghouse, which waited until the judge had disposed of the case and then decided that the fines</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark226"><span>and prison sentences he had handed out to its stable of offenders were chastisement enough, and did<br/>not itself penalize them at all. Some people saw this attitude as evidence that Westinghouse was<br/>condoning the conspiracies, but others regarded it as a commendable, if tacit, admission that<br/>management at the highest level in the conniving companies was responsible—morally, at least—for<br/>the whole mess and was therefore in no position to discipline its erring employees. In the view of<br/>these people, G.E.’s haste to penalize the acknowledged culprits on its payroll strongly suggested that<br/>the firm was trying to save its own skin by throwing a few luckless employees to the wolves, or—as<br/>Senator Philip A. Hart, of Michigan, put it, more pungently, during the hearings—“to do a Pontius<br/>Pilate operation.”</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark227"><span class="s6">EMBATTLED </span></a><span>days at 570 Lexington Avenue! After years of cloaking the company in the mantle of a<br/>wise and benevolent corporate institution, the public-relations people at G.E. headquarters were<br/>faced with the ugly choice of representing its role in the price-fixing affair as that of either a fool or a<br/>knave. They tended strongly toward “fool.” Judge Ganey, by his statement that he assumed the<br/>conspiracies to have been not only condoned but approved by the top brass and the company as a<br/>whole, clearly chose “knave.” But his analysis may or may not have been the right one, and after<br/>reading the Kefauver Subcommittee testimony I have come to the melancholy conclusion that the truth<br/>will very likely never be known. For, as the testimony shows, the clear waters of moral responsibility<br/>at G.E. became hopelessly muddied by a struggle to communicate—a struggle so confused that in<br/>some cases, it would appear, if one of the big bosses at G.E. </span><i>had </i><span>ordered a subordinate to break the<br/>law, the message would somehow have been garbled in its reception, and if the subordinate </span><i>had</i><span>informed the boss that he was holding conspiratorial meetings with competitors, the boss might well<br/>have been under the impression that the subordinate was gossiping idly about lawn parties or<br/>pinochle sessions. Specifically, it would appear that a subordinate who received a direct oral order<br/>from his boss had to figure out whether it meant what it seemed to or the exact opposite, while the<br/>boss, in conversing with a subordinate, had to figure out whether he should take what the man told<br/></span><i>him </i><span>at face value or should attempt to translate it out of a secret code to which he was by no means<br/>sure he had the key. That was the problem in a nutshell, and I state it here thus baldly as a suggestion<br/>for any potential beneficiary of a foundation who may be casting about for a suitable project on which<br/>to draw up a prospectus.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>For the past eight years or so, G.E. had had a company rule called Directive Policy 20.5, which<br/>read, in part, “No employee shall enter into any understanding, agreement, plan or scheme, expressed<br/>or implied, formal or informal, with any competitor, in regard to prices, terms or conditions of sale,<br/>production,distribution, territories, or customers; nor exchange or discuss with a competitor prices,<br/>terms or conditions of sale, or any other competitive information.” In effect, this rule was simply an<br/>injunction to G.E.’s personnel to obey the federal antitrust laws, except that it was somewhat more<br/>concrete and comprehensive in the matter of price than they are. It was almost impossible for<br/>executives with jurisdiction over pricing policies at G.E. to be unaware of 20.5, or even hazy about<br/>it, because to make sure that new executives were acquainted with it and to refresh the memories of<br/>old ones, the company formally reissued and distributed it at intervals, and all such executives were<br/>asked to sign their names to it as an earnest that they were currently complying with it and intended to<br/>keep on doing so. The trouble—at least during the period covered by the court action, and apparently<br/>for a long time before that as well—was that some people at G.E., including some of those who<br/>regularly signed 20.5, simply did not believe that it was to be taken seriously. They assumed that 20.5<br/>was mere window dressing: that it was on the books solely to provide legal protection for the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>company and for the higher-ups; that meeting illegally with competitors was recognized and accepted<br/>as standard practice within the company; and that often when a ranking executive ordered a<br/>subordinate executive to comply with 20.5, he was actually ordering him to violate it. Illogical as it<br/>might seem, this last assumption becomes comprehensible in the light of the fact that, for a time, when<br/>some executives orally conveyed, or reconveyed, the order, they were apparently in the habit of<br/>accompanying it with an unmistakable wink. In May of 1948, for example, there was a meeting of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark228"><span>G.E. sales managers during which the custom of winking was openly discussed. Robert Paxton, an<br/>upper-level G.E. executive who later became the company’s president, addressed the meeting and<br/>delivered the usual admonition about antitrust violations, whereupon William S. Ginn, then a sales<br/>executive in the transformer division, under Paxton’s authority, startled him by saying, “I didn’t see<br/>you wink.” Paxton replied firmly, “There was no wink. We mean it, and these are the orders.” Asked<br/>by Senator Kefauver how long he had been aware  that orders issued at G.E. were  sometimes<br/>accompanied by winks, Paxton replied that he had first observed the practice way back in 1935, when<br/>his boss had given him an instruction along with a wink or its equivalent, and that when, some time<br/>later, the significance of the gesture dawned on him, he had become so incensed that he had with<br/>difficulty restrained himself from jeopardizing his career by punching the boss in the nose. Paxton<br/>went on to say that his objections to the practice of winking had been so strong as to earn him a<br/>reputation in the company for being an antiwink man, and that he, for his part, had never winked.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark229"><span>Although Paxton would seem to have left little doubt as to how he intended his winkless order of<br/>1948 to be interpreted, its meaning failed to get through to Ginn, for not long after it was issued, he<br/>went out and fixed prices to a fare-thee-well. (Obviously, it takes more than one company to make a<br/>price-fixing  agreement, but all the testimony tends to indicate that it was G.E. that generally set the<br/>pattern for the rest of the industry in such matters.) Thirteen years later, Ginn—fresh from a few<br/>weeks in jail, and fresh out of a $135,000-a-year job—appeared before the Subcommittee to account<br/>for, among other things, his strange response to the winkless order. He had disregarded it, he said,<br/>because he had received a contrary order from two of his other superiors in the G.E. chain of<br/>command, Henry V. B. Erben and Francis Fairman, and in explaining why he had heeded their order<br/>rather than Paxton’s he introduced the fascinating concept of degrees of communication—another<br/>theme for a foundation grantee to get his teeth into. Erben and Fairman, Ginn said, had been more<br/>articulate, persuasive, and forceful in issuing their order than Paxton had been in issuing his; Fairman,<br/>especially, Ginn stressed, had proved to be “a great communicator, a great philosopher, and, frankly,<br/>a great believer in stability of prices.” Both Erben and Fairman had dismissed Paxton as naïve, Ginn<br/>testified, and, in further summary of how he had been led astray, he said that “the people who were<br/>advocating the Devil were able to sell me better than the philosophers that were selling the Lord.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It would be helpful to have at hand a report from Erben and Fairman themselves on the<br/>communication technique that enabled them to prevail over Paxton, but unfortunately neither of these<br/>philosophers could testify before the Subcommittee, because by the time of the hearings both of them<br/>were dead. Paxton, who was available, was described in Ginn’s testimony as having been at all times<br/>one of the philosopher-salesmen on the side of the Lord. “I can clarify Mr. Paxton by saying Mr.<br/>Paxton came closer to being an Adam Smith advocate than any businessman I have met in America,”<br/>Ginn declared. Still, in 1950, when Ginn admitted to Paxton in casual conversation that he had<br/>“compromised himself” in respect to antitrust matters, Paxton merely told him that he was a damned<br/>fool, and did not report the confession to anyone else in the company. Testifying as to why he did not,<br/>Paxton said that when the conversation occurred he was no longer Ginn’s boss, and that, in the light of<br/>his personal ethics, repeating such an admission by a man not under his authority would be “gossip”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and “talebearing.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Meanwhile, Ginn, no longer answerable to Paxton, was meeting with competitors at frequent<br/>intervals and moving steadily up the corporate ladder. In November, 1954, he was made general<br/>manager of the transformer division, whose headquarters were in Pittsfield, Massachusetts—a job<br/>that put him in line for a vice-presidency. At the time of Ginn’s shift, Ralph J. Cordiner, who has been<br/>chairman of the board of General Electric since 1949, called him down to New York for the express<br/>purpose of enjoining him to comply strictly and undeviatingly with Directive Policy 20.5. Cordiner<br/>communicated this  idea so successfully that it was clear enough to Ginn at the moment, but it<br/>remained so only as long as it took him, after leaving the chairman, to walk to Erben’s office. There<br/>his comprehension of what he had just heard became clouded. Erben, who was head of G.E.’s<br/>distribution group, ranked directly below Cordiner and directly above Ginn, and, according to Ginn’s<br/>testimony, no sooner were they alone in his office than he countermanded Cordiner’s injunction,<br/>saying, “Now, keep on doing the way that you have been doing, but just be sensible about it and use<br/>your head on the subject.” Erben’s extraordinary communicative prowess again carried the day, and<br/>Ginn continued to meet with competitors. “I knew Mr. Cordiner could fire me,” he told Senator<br/>Kefauver, “but also I knew I was working for Mr. Erben.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At the end of 1954, Paxton took over Erben’s job and thereby became Ginn’s boss again. Ginn<br/>went right on meeting with competitors, but, since he was aware that Paxton disapproved of the<br/>practice, didn’t tell him about it. Moreover, he testified, within a month or two he had become<br/>convinced that he could not afford to discontinue attending the meetings under any circumstances, for<br/>in January, 1955, the entire electrical-equipment industry became embroiled in a drastic price war—<br/>known as the “white sale,” because of its timing and the bargains it afforded to buyers—in which the<br/>erstwhile amiable competitors began fiercely undercutting one another. Such a manifestation of free<br/>enterprise was, of course, exactly what the intercompany conspiracies were intended to prevent, but<br/>just at that time the supply of electrical apparatus so greatly exceeded the demand that first a few of<br/>the conspirators and then more and more began breaking the agreements they themselves had made. In<br/>dealing with the situation as best he could, Ginn said, he “used the philosophies that had been taught<br/>me previously”—by which he meant that he continued to conduct price-fixing meetings, in the hope<br/>that at least </span><i>some </i><span>of the agreements made at them would be honored. As for Paxton, in Ginn’s opinion<br/>that philosopher was not only ignorant of the meetings but so constant in his devotion to the concept of<br/>free and aggressive competition that he actually enjoyed the price war, disastrous though it was to<br/>everybody’s profits. (In his own testimony, Paxton vigorously denied that he had enjoyed it.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark230"><span>Within a year or so, the electrical-equipment industry took an upturn, and in January, 1957, Ginn,<br/>having ridden out the storm relatively well, got his vice-presidency. At the same time, he was<br/>transferred to Schenectady, to become general manager of G.E.’s turbine-generator division, and<br/>Cordiner again called him into headquarters and gave him a lecture on 20.5. Such lectures were<br/>getting to be a routine with Cordiner; every time a new employee was assigned to a strategic<br/>managerial post, or an old employee was  promoted to such a post, the lucky fellow could be<br/>reasonably certain that he would be summoned to the chairman’s office to hear a rendition of the<br/>austere creed. In his book </span></a><i>The Heart of Japan</i><span>, Alexander Campbell reports that a large Japanese<br/>electrical concern has drawn up a list of seven company commandments (for example, “Be courteous<br/>and sincere!”), and that each morning, in each of its thirty factories, the workers are required to stand<br/>at attention and recite these in unison, and then to sing the company song (“For ever-increasing<br/>production/Love your work, give your all!”). Cordiner did not require his subordinates to recite or<br/>sing 20.5—as far as is known, he never even had it set to music—but from the number of times men</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>like Ginn had it read to them or otherwise recalled to their attention, they must have come to know it<br/>well enough to chant it, improvising a tune as they went along.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>This time, Cordiner’s message not only made an impression on Ginn’s mind but stuck there in<br/>unadulterated form. Ginn, according to his testimony, became a reformed executive and dropped his<br/>price-fixing habits overnight. However, it appears that his sudden conversion cannot be attributed<br/>wholly to Cordiner’s powers of communication, or even to the drip-drip-drip effect of repetition, for<br/>it was to a considerable extent pragmatic in character, like the conversion of Henry VIII to<br/>Protestantism. He reformed, Ginn explained to the Subcommittee, because his “air cover was gone.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Your what was gone?” Senator Kefauver asked.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark231"><span>“My air cover was gone,” replied Ginn. “I mean I had lost my air cover. Mr. Erben wasn’t around<br/>any more, and all of my colleagues had gone, and I was now working directly for Mr. Paxton,<br/>knowing his feelings on the matter.… Any philosophy that I had grown up with before in the past was<br/>now out the window.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>If Erben, who had not been Ginn’s boss since late in 1954, had been the source of his air cover,<br/>Ginn must have been without its protection for over two years, but, presumably, in the excitement of<br/>the price war he had failed to notice its absence. However that may have been, here he now was, a<br/>man suddenly shorn not only of his air cover but of his philosophy. Swiftly filling the latter void with<br/>a whole new set of principles, he circulated copies of 20.5 among his department managers in the<br/>turbine-generator division and topped this off by energetically adopting what he called a “leprosy<br/>policy”; that is, he advised his subordinates to avoid even casual social contacts with their<br/>counterparts in competing companies, because “once the relationships are established, I have come to<br/>the conclusion after many years of hard experience that the relationships tend to spread and the hanky-<br/>panky begins to get going.” But now fate played a cruel trick on Ginn, and, all unknowing, he landed<br/>in the very position that Paxton and Cordiner had been in for years—that of a philosopher vainly<br/>endeavoring to sell the Lord to a flock that declined to buy his message and was, in fact,<br/>systematically engaging in the hanky-panky its leader had warned it against. Specifically, during the<br/>whole of 1957 and 1958 and the first part of 1959 two of Ginn’s subordinates were piously signing</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>20.5 with one hand and, with the other, briskly drawing up price-fixing agreements at a whole series<br/>of meetings—in New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; Hot Springs, Virginia; and Skytop, Pennsylvania,<br/>to name a few of their gathering places.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark232"><span>It appears that Ginn had not been able to impart much of his shining new philosophy to others, and<br/>that at the root of his difficulty lay that old jinx, the problem of communicating. Asked at the hearings<br/>how his subordinates could possibly have gone so far astray, he replied, “I have got to admit that I<br/>made a communication error. I didn’t sell this thing to the boys well enough.… The price is so<br/>important in the complete running of a business that, philosophically, we have got to sell people not<br/>only just the fact that it is against the law, but … that it shouldn’t be done for many, many reasons. But<br/>it has got to be a philosophical approach and a communication approach.… Even though … I had told<br/>my associates not to do this, some of the boys did get off the reservation.… I have to admit to myself<br/>here an area of a failure in communications … which I am perfectly willing to accept my part of the<br/>responsibility for.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In earnestly striving to analyze the cause of the failure, Ginn said, he had reached the conclusion<br/>that merely issuing directives, no matter how frequently, was not enough; what was needed was “a<br/>complete philosophy, a complete understanding, a complete breakdown of barriers between people,<br/>if we are going to get some understanding and really live and manage these companies within the<br/>philosophies that they should be managed in.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Senator Hart permitted himself to comment, “You can communicate until you are dead and gone,<br/>butif the point you are communicating about, even though it be a law of the land, strikes your<br/>audience as something that is just a folklore … you will never sell the package.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ginn ruefully conceded that that was true.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THE <span class="p">concept of degrees of communication was further developed, by implication, in the testimony of<br/>another defendant, Frank E. Stehlik, who had been general manager of the G.E. low-voltage-<br/>switchgear department from May, 1956, to February, 1960. (As all but a tiny minority of the users of<br/>electricity are contentedly unaware, switchgear serves to control and protect apparatus used in the<br/>generation, conversion, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy, and more than $100<br/>million worth of it is sold annually in the United States.) Stehlik received some of his business<br/>guidance in the conventional form of orders, oral and written, and some—perhaps just as much, to<br/>judge by his testimony—through a less intellectual, more visceral medium of communication that he<br/>called “impacts.” Apparently, when something happened within the company that made an impression<br/>on him, he would consult a sort of internal metaphysical voltmeter to ascertain the force of the jolt<br/>that he had received, and, from the reading he got, would attempt to gauge the true drift of company<br/>policy. For example, he testified that during 1956, 1957, and most of 1958 he believed that G.E. was<br/>frankly and fully in favor of complying with 20.5. But then, in the autumn of 1958, George E. Burens,<br/>Stehlik’s immediate superior, told him that he, Burens, had been directed by Paxton, who by then was<br/>president of G.E., to have lunch with Max Scott, president of the I-T-E Circuit Breaker Company, an<br/>important competitor in the switchgear market. Paxton said in his own testimony that while he had<br/>indeed asked Burens to have lunch with Scott, he had instructed him categorically not to talk about<br/>prices, but apparently Burens did not mention this caveat to Stehlik; in any event, the disclosure that<br/>the high command had told Burens to lunch with an archrival, Stehlik testified, “had a heavy impact<br/>on me.” Asked to amplify this, he said, “There are a great many impacts that influence me in my<br/>thinking as to the true attitude of the company, and that was one of them.” As the impacts, great and<br/>small, piled up, their cumulative effect finally communicated to Stehlik that he had been wrong in<br/>supposing the company had any real respect for 20.5. Accordingly, when, late in 1958, Stehlik was<br/>ordered by Burens to begin holding price meetings with the competitors, he was not in the least<br/>surprised.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Stehlik’s compliance with Burens’ order ultimately brought on a whole new series of impacts, of a<br/>much more crudely communicative sort. In February, 1960, General Electric cut his annual pay from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$70,000 to $26,000 for violating 20.5; a year later Judge Ganey gave him a three-thousand-dollar fine<br/>and a suspended thirty-day jail sentence for violating the Sherman Act; and about a month after </span><i>that</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark233"><span>G.E. asked for, and got, his resignation. Indeed, during his last years with the firm Stehlik seems to<br/>have received almost as many lacerating impacts as a Raymond Chandler hero. But testimony given at<br/>the hearings by L. B. Gezon, manager of the marketing section of the low-voltage-switchgear<br/>department, indicated that Stehlik, again like a Chandler hero, was capable of dishing out blunt<br/>impacts as well as taking them. Gezon, who was directly under Stehlik in the line of command, told<br/>the Subcommittee that although he had taken part in price-fixing meetings prior to April, 1956, when<br/>Stehlik became his boss, he did not subsequently engage in any antitrust violations until late 1958, and<br/>that he did so then only as the result of an impact that bore none of the subtlety noted by Stehlik in his<br/>early experience with this phenomenon. The impact came directly from Stehlik, who, it seems, left<br/>nothing to chance in communicating with his subordinates. In Gezon’s words, Stehlik told him “to<br/>resume the meetings; that the company policy was unchanged; the risk was just as great as it ever had</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>been; and that if our activities were discovered, I personally would be dismissed or disciplined [by<br/>the company], as well as punished by the government.” So Gezon was left with three choices: to quit,<br/>to disobey the direct order  of his superior  (in which case, he thought, “they might have found<br/>somebody else to do my job”), or to obey the order, and thereby violate the antitrust laws, with no<br/>immunity against the possible consequences. In short, his alternatives were comparable to those faced<br/>by an international spy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Although Gezon did resume the meetings, he was not indicted, possibly because he had been a<br/>relatively minor price-fixer. General Electric, for its part, demoted him but did not require him to<br/>resign. Yet it would be a mistake to assume that Gezon was relatively untouched by his experience.<br/>Asked by Senator Kefauver if he did not think that Stehlik’s order had placed him in an intolerable<br/>position, he replied that it had not struck him that way at the time. Asked whether he thought it unjust<br/>that he had suffered demotion for carrying out the order of a superior, he replied, “I personally don’t<br/>consider it so.” To judge by his answers, the impact on Gezon’s heart and mind would seem to have<br/>been heavy indeed.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark234">THE </a><span class="p">other side of the communication problem—the difficulty that a superior is likely to encounter in<br/>understanding what a subordinate tells him—is graphically illustrated by the testimony of Raymond</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark235"><span>W. Smith, who was general manager of G.E.’s transformer division from the beginning of 1957 until<br/>late in 1959, and of Arthur F. Vinson, who in October, 1957, was appointed vice-president in charge<br/>of G.E.’s apparatus group, and also a member of the company’s executive committee. Smith’s job<br/>was the one Ginn had held for the previous two years, and when Vinson got </span></a><i>his </i><span>job, he became<br/>Smith’s immediate boss. Smith’s highest pay during the period in question was roughly $100,000 a<br/>year, while Vinson reached a basic salary of $110,000 and also got a variable bonus, ranging from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$45,000 to $100,000. Smith testified that on January 1, 1957, the very day he took charge of the<br/>transformer division—and a holiday, at that—he met with Chairman Cordiner and Executive Vice-<br/>President Paxton, and Cordiner gave him the familiar admonition about living up to 20.5. However,<br/>later that year, the competitive going got so rough that transformers were selling at discounts of as<br/>much as 35 percent, and Smith decided on his own hook that the time had come to begin negotiating<br/>with rival firms in the hope of stabilizing the market. He felt that he was justified in doing this, he<br/>said, because he was convinced that both in company circles and in the whole industry negotiations of<br/>this kind were “the order of the day.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark236"><span>By the time Vinson became his superior, in October, Smith was regularly attending price-fixing<br/>meetings, and he felt that he ought to let his new boss know what he was doing. Accordingly, he told<br/>the Subcommittee, on two or three occasions when the two men found themselves alone together in<br/>the normal course of business, he said to Vinson, “I had a meeting with the clan this morning.”<br/>Counsel for the Subcommittee asked Smith whether he had ever put the matter more bluntly—whether,<br/>for example, he had ever said anything like “We’re meeting with competitors to fix prices. We’re<br/>going to have a little conspiracy here and I don’t want it to get out.” Smith replied that he had never<br/>said anything remotely like that—had done nothing more than make remarks on the order of “I had a<br/>meeting with the clan this morning.” He did not elaborate on why he did not speak with greater<br/>directness, but two logical possibilities present themselves. Perhaps he hoped that he could keep<br/>Vinson informed about the situation and at the same time protect him from the risk of becoming an<br/>accomplice. Or perhaps he had no such intention, and was simply expressing himself in the oblique,<br/>colloquial way that characterized much of his speaking. (Paxton, a close friend of Smith’s, had once<br/>complained to Smith that he was “given to being somewhat cryptic” in his remarks.) Anyhow, Vinson,</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>according to his own testimony, had flatly misunderstood what Smith meant; indeed, he could not<br/>recall ever hearing Smith use the expression “meeting of the clan,” although he did recall his saying<br/>things like “Well, I am going to take this new plan on transformers and show it to the boys.” Vinson<br/>testified that he had thought the “boys” meant the G.E. district sales people and the company’s<br/>customers, and that the “new plan” was a new marketing plan; he said that it had come as a rude<br/>shock to him to learn—a couple of years later, after the case had broken—that in speaking of the<br/>“boys” and the “new plan,” Smith had been referring to competitors and a price-fixing scheme. “I<br/>think Mr. Smith is a sincere man,” Vinson testified. “I am sure Mr. Smith … thought he was telling me<br/>that he was going to one of these meetings. This meant nothing to me.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Smith, on the other hand, was confident that his meaning had got through to Vinson. “I never got the<br/>impression that he misunderstood me,” he insisted to the Subcommittee. Questioning Vinson later,<br/>Kefauver asked whether an executive in his position, with thirty-odd years’ experience in the<br/>electrical industry, could possibly be so naive as to misunderstand a subordinate on such a<br/>substantive matter as grasping who the “boys” were. “I don’t think it is too naive,” replied Vinson.<br/>“We have a lot of boys.… I may be naïve, but I am certainly telling the truth, and in this kind of thing I<br/>am sure I am naïve.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SENATOR KEFAUVER: Mr. Vinson, you wouldn’t be a vice-president at $200,000 a year if you were naïve.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MR. VINSON: I think I could well get there by being naïve in this area. It might help.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark237"><span>Here, in a different field altogether, the communication problem again comes to the fore. Was<br/>Vinson really saying to Kefauver what he seemed to be saying—that naïveté about antitrust violations<br/>might be a help to a man in getting and holding a $200,000-a-year job at General Electric? It seems<br/>unlikely. And yet what else could he have meant? Whatever the answer, neither the federal antitrust<br/>men nor the Senate investigators were able to prove that Smith succeeded in his attempts to<br/>communicate to Vinson the fact that he was engaging in price-fixing. And, lacking such proof, they<br/>were unable to establish what they gave every appearance of going all out to establish if they could:<br/>namely, that at least some one man at the pinnacle of G.E.’s management—some member of the sacred<br/>executive committee itself—was implicated. Actually, when the story of the conspiracies first<br/>became known, Vinson not only concurred in a company decision to punish Smith by drastically<br/>demoting him but personally informed him of the decision—two acts that, if he had grasped Smith’s<br/>meaning back in 1957, would have denoted a remarkable degree of cynicism and hypocrisy. (Smith,<br/>by the way, rather than accept the demotion, quit General Electric and, after being fined three<br/>thousand dollars and given a suspended thirty-day prison sentence by Judge Ganey, found a job<br/>elsewhere, at ten thousand dollars a year.)</span></a><a name="bookmark238">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>This was not Vinson’s only brush with the case. He was also among those named in one of the<br/>grand jury  indictments that precipitated the court action, this time in connection not with his<br/>comprehension of Smith’s jargon but with the conspiracy in the switchgear department. On this aspect<br/>of the case, four switchgear executives—Burens, Stehlik, Clarence E. Burke, and H. Frank Hentschel</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—testified before the grand jury (and later before the Subcommittee) that at some time in July,<br/>August, or September of 1958 (none of them could establish the precise date) Vinson had had lunch<br/>with them in Dining Room B of G.E.’s switchgear works in Philadelphia, and that during the meal he<br/>had instructed them to hold price meetings with competitors. As a result of this order, they said, a<br/>meeting attended by representatives of G.E., Westinghouse, the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing<br/>Company, the Federal Pacific Electric Company, and the I-T-E Circuit Breaker Company was held at<br/>the Hotel Traymore in Atlantic City on November 9, 1958, at which sales of switchgear to federal,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark239"><span>state, and municipal agencies  were divvied up, with General Electric to get 39 percent of the<br/>business, Westinghouse 35 percent, I-T-E 11 percent, Allis-Chalmers 8 percent, and Federal Pacific<br/>Electric 7 percent. At subsequent meetings, agreement was reached on allocating sales of switchgear<br/>to private buyers as well, and an elaborate formula was worked out whereby the privilege of<br/>submitting the lowest bid to prospective customers was rotated among the conspiring companies at<br/>two-week intervals. Because of its periodic nature, this was called the phase-of-the-moon formula—<br/>a designation that in due time led to the following lyrical exchange between the Subcommittee and L.</span></a><a name="bookmark240">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">W. Long, an executive of Allis-Chalmers:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SENATOR KEFAUVER: Who were the phasers-of-the-mooners—phase-of-the-mooners?</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span>MR.

No.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Vinson told the Justice Department prosecutors, and repeated to the Subcommittee, that he had not<br/>known about the Traymore meeting, the phase-of-the-mooners, or the existence of the conspiracy<br/>itself until the case broke; as for the lunch in Dining Room B, he insisted that it had never taken place.<br/>On this point, Burens, Stehlik, Burke, and Hentschel submitted to lie-detector tests, administered by<br/>the F.B.I., and passed them. Vinson refused to take a lie-detector test, at first explaining that he was<br/>acting on advice of counsel and against his personal inclination, and later, after hearing how the four<br/>other men had fared, arguing that if the machine had not pronounced them liars, it couldn’t be any<br/>good. It was established that on only eight business days during July, August, and September had<br/>Burens, Burke, Stehlik, and Hentschel all been together in the Philadelphia plant at the lunch hour, and<br/>Vinson produced some of his expense accounts, which, he pointed out to the Justice Department,<br/>showed that he had been elsewhere on each of those days. Confronted with this evidence, the Justice<br/>Department dropped its case against Vinson, and he stayed on as a vice-president of General Electric.<br/>Nothing that the Subcommittee elicited from him cast any substantive doubt on the defense that had<br/>impressed the government prosecutors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark241"><span>Thus, the uppermost echelon at G.E. came through unscathed; the record showed that participation<br/>in the conspiracy went fairly far down in the organization but not all the way to the top. Gezon,<br/>everybody agreed, had followed orders from Stehlik, and Stehlik had followed orders from Burens,<br/>but that was the end of the trail, because although Burens said he had followed orders from Vinson,<br/>Vinson denied it and made the denial stick. The government, at the end of its investigation, stated in<br/>court that it could not prove, and did not claim, that either Chairman Cordiner or President Paxton had<br/>authorized, or even known about, the conspiracies, and thereby officially ruled out the possibility that<br/>they had resorted to at least a figurative wink. Later, Paxton and Cordiner showed up in Washington<br/>to testify before the Subcommittee, and its interrogators were similarly unable to establish that they<br/>had ever indulged in any variety of winking.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AFTER <span class="p">being described by Ginn as General Electric’s stubbornest and most dedicated advocate of free<br/>competition, Paxton explained to the Subcommittee that his thinking on the subject had been<br/>influenced not directly by Adam Smith but, rather, by way of a former G.E. boss he had worked under</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—the late Gerard Swope. Swope, Paxton testified, had always believed firmly that the ultimate goal<br/>ofbusiness was to produce more goods for more people at lower cost. “I bought that then, I buy it<br/>now,” said Paxton. “I think it is the most marvelous statement of economic philosophy that any</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark242"><span>industrialist has ever expressed.” In the course of his testimony, Paxton had an explanation,<br/>philosophical or otherwise, of each of the several situations related to price-fixing in which his name<br/>had earlier been mentioned. For instance, it had been brought out that in 1956 or 1957 a young man<br/>named Jerry Page, a minor employee in G.E.’s switchgear division, had written directly to Cordiner<br/>alleging that the switchgear divisions of G.E. and of several competitor companies were involved in<br/>a conspiracy in which information about prices was exchanged by means of a secret code based on<br/>different colors of letter paper. Cordiner had turned the matter over to Paxton with orders that he get<br/>to the bottom of it, and Paxton had thereupon conducted an investigation that led him to conclude that<br/>the color-code conspiracy was “wholly a hallucination on the part of this boy.” In arriving at that<br/>conclusion, Paxton had apparently been right, although it later came out that there had been a<br/>conspiracy in the switchgear division during 1956 and 1957; this, however, was a rather conventional<br/>one, based simply on price-fixing meetings, rather than on anything so gaudy as a color code. Page<br/>could not be called to testify because of ill health.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Paxton conceded that there had been some occasions when he “must have been pretty damn dumb.”<br/>(Dumb or not, for his services as the company’s president he was, of course, remunerated on a<br/>considerably grander scale than Vinson—receiving a basic annual salary of $125,000, plus annual<br/>incentive compensation of about $175,000, plus stock options designed to enable him to collect much<br/>more at low tax rates.) As for Paxton’s attitude toward company communications, he emerges as a<br/>pessimist on this score. Upon being asked at the hearings to comment on the Smith-Vinson<br/>conversations of 1957, he said that, knowing Smith, he just could not “cast the man in the role of a<br/>liar,” and went on:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>When I was younger, I used to play a good deal of bridge. We played about fifty rubbers of bridge, four of us, every winter, and I think<br/>we probably played some rather good bridge. If you gentlemen are bridge players, you know that there is a code of signals that is<br/>exchanged between partners as the game progresses.  It is a stylized form of playing.… Now, as I think about this—and I was<br/>particularly impressed when I read Smith’s testimony when he talked about a “meeting of the clan” or “meeting of the boys”—I begin to<br/>think that there must have been a stylized method of communication between these people who were dealing with competition. Now,<br/>Smith could say, “I told Vinson what I was doing,” and Vinson wouldn’t have the foggiest idea what was being told to him, and both men<br/>could testify under oath, one saying yes and the other man saying no, and both be telling the truth.… [They] wouldn’t be on the same<br/>wavelength. [They] wouldn’t have the same meanings. I think, I believe now that these men did think that they were telling the truth, but<br/>they weren’t communicating between each other with understanding.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here, certainly, is the gloomiest possible analysis of the communications problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark243"><span class="s6">CHAIRMAN </span></a><span>Cordiner’s status, it appears from his testimony, was approximately that of the Boston<br/>Cabots in the celebrated jingle. His services to the company, for which he was recompensed in truly<br/>handsome style (with, for 1960, a salary of just over $280,000, plus contingent deferred income of<br/>about $120,000, plus stock options potentially worth hundreds of thousands more), were indubitably<br/>many and valuable, but they were performed on such an exalted level that, at least in antitrust matters,<br/>he does not seem to have been able to have any earthly communication at all. When he emphatically<br/>told the Subcommittee that at no time had he had so much as an inkling of the network of conspiracies,<br/>it could be deduced that his was a case not of faulty communication but of no communication. He did<br/>not speak to the Subcommittee of philosophy or philosophers, as Ginn and Paxton had done, but from<br/>his past record of ordering reissues of 20.5 and of peppering his speeches and public statements with<br/>praise of free enterprise, it seems clear that he was </span><i>un philosophe sans le savoir</i><span>—and one on the<br/>side of selling the Lord, since no evidence was adduced to suggest that he was given to winking in<br/>any form. Kefauver ran through a long list of antitrust violations of which General Electric had been</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>accused over the past half-century, asking Cordiner, who joined the company in 1922, how much he<br/>knew about each of them; usually, he replied that he had known about them only after the fact. In<br/>commenting on Ginn’s testimony that Erben had countermanded Cordiner’s direct order in 1954,<br/>Cordiner said that he had read it with “great alarm” and “great wonderment,” since Erben had always<br/>indicated to him “an intense competitive spirit,” rather than any disposition to be friendly with rival<br/>companies.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Throughout his testimony, Cordiner used the curious expression “be responsive to.” If, for instance,<br/>Kefauver inadvertently asked the same question twice, Cordiner would say, “I was responsive to that<br/>a moment ago,” or if Kefauver interrupted him, as he often did, Cordiner would ask politely, “May I<br/>be responsive?” This, too, offers a small lead for a foundation grantee, who might want to look into<br/>the distinction between being responsive (a passive state) and answering (an act), and their relative<br/>effectiveness in the process of communication.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark244"><span>Summing up his position on the case as a whole, in reply to a question of Kefauver’s about whether<br/>he thought that G.E. had incurred “corporate disgrace,” Cordiner said, “No, I am not going to be<br/>responsive and say that General Electric had corporate disgrace. I am going to say that we are deeply<br/>grieved and concerned.… I am not proud of it.”</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark245"><span class="s6">CHAIRMAN </span></a><span>Cordiner, then, had been able to fairly deafen his subordinate officers with lectures on<br/>compliance with the rules of the company and the laws of the country, but he had not been able to get<br/>all those officers to comply with either, and President Paxton could muse thoughtfully on how it was<br/>that two of his subordinates who had given radically different accounts of a conversation between<br/>them could be not liars but merely poor communicators. Philosophy seems to have reached a high<br/>point at G.E., and communication a low one. If executives could just learn to understand one another,<br/>most of the witnesses said or implied, the problem of antitrust violations would be solved. But<br/>perhaps the problem is cultural as well as technical, and has something to do with a loss of personal<br/>identity that comes from working in a huge organization. The cartoonist Jules Feiffer, contemplating<br/>the communication problem in a nonindustrial context, has said, “Actually, the breakdown is between<br/>the person and himself. If you’re not able to communicate successfully between yourself and yourself,<br/>how are you supposed to make it with the strangers outside?” Suppose, purely as a hypothesis, that<br/>the owner of a company who orders his subordinates to obey the antitrust laws has such poor<br/>communication with himself that he does not really know whether he wants the order to be complied<br/>with or not. If his order is disobeyed, the resulting price-fixing may benefit his company’s coffers; if<br/>it is obeyed, then he has done the right thing. In the first instance, he is not personally implicated in<br/>any wrongdoing, while in the second he is positively involved in </span><i>right </i><span>doing. What, after all, can he<br/>lose? It is perhaps reasonable to suppose that such an executive might communicate his uncertainty<br/>more forcefully than his order. Possibly yet another foundation grantee should have a look at the<br/>reverse of communication failure, where he might discover that messages the sender does not even<br/>realize he is sending sometimes turn out to have got across only too effectively.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Meanwhile, in the first years after the Subcommittee concluded its investigation, the defendant<br/>companies were by no means allowed to forget their transgressions. The law permits customers who<br/>can prove that they have paid artificially high prices as a result of antitrust violations to sue for<br/>damages—in most cases, triple damages—and suits running into many millions of dollars piled up so<br/>high that Chief Justice Warren had to set up a special panel of federal judges to plan how they should<br/>all be handled. Needless to say, Cordiner was not allowed to forget about the matter, either; indeed, it<br/>would be surprising if he was allowed a chance to think about much else, for, in addition to the suits,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>he had to contend with active efforts—unsuccessful, as it turned out—by a minority group of<br/>stockholders to unseat him. Paxton retired as president in April, 1961, because of ill health dating<br/>back at least to the previous January, when he underwent a major operation. As for the executives<br/>who pleaded guilty and were fined or imprisoned, most of those who had been employed by<br/>companies other than G.E. remained with them, either in their old jobs or in similar ones. Of those<br/>who had been employed by G.E., none remained there. Some retired permanently from business,<br/>others settled for comparatively small jobs, and a few landed big ones—most spectacularly Ginn,<br/>who in June, 1961, became president of Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton, manufacturers of heavy machinery.<br/>And as for the future of price-fixing in the electrical industry, it seems safe to say that what with the<br/>Justice Department, Judge Ganey, Senator Kefauver, and the triple-damage suits, the impact on the<br/>philosophers who guide corporate policy was such that they, and even their subordinates, were likely<br/>to try to hew scrupulously to the line for quite some time. Quite a different question, however, is<br/>whether they had made any headway in their ability to communicate.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark246">8</a><a name="bookmark247">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark248">The Last Great Corner</a><a name="bookmark249">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark250">BETWEEN SPRING </a><span class="p">and midsummer, 1958, the common stock of the E.

This startling, even alarming, rise was made in an ascending scale that was climaxed by a<br/>frantic crescendo in which the price went up a hundred dollars a share in a single day. Nothing of the<br/>sort had happened for a generation. Furthermore—and even more alarming—the rise did not seem to<br/>have the slightest bit of relation to any sudden hunger on the part of the American public for new<br/>hardwood floors. To the consternation of almost everyone concerned, conceivably including even<br/>some of the holders of Bruce stock, it seemed to be entirely the result of a technical stock-market<br/>situation called a corner. With the exception of a general panic such as occurred in 1929, a corner is<br/>the most drastic and spectacular of all developments that can occur in the stock market, and more than<br/>once in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, corners had threatened to wreck the national<br/>economy.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The Bruce situation never threatened to do that. For one thing, the Bruce Company was so small in<br/>relation to the economy as a whole that even the wildest gyrations in its stock could hardly have much<br/>national effect. For another, the Bruce “corner” was accidental—the by-product of a fight for<br/>corporate control—rather than the result of calculated manipulations, as most of the historic corners<br/>had been. Finally, this one eventually turned out to be not a true corner at all, but only a near thing; in<br/>September, Bruce stock quieted down and settled at a reasonable level. But the incident served to stir<br/>up memories, some of them perhaps tinged with nostalgia, among those flinty old Wall Streeters who<br/>had been around to see the classic corners—or at least the last of them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark251"><span>In June of 1922, the New York Stock Exchange began listing the shares of a corporation called<br/>Piggly Wiggly Stores—a chain of retail self-service markets situated mostly in the South and West,<br/>with headquarters in Memphis—and the stage was set for one of the most dramatic financial battles of<br/>that gaudy decade when Wall Street, only negligently watched over by the federal government, was<br/>frequently sent reeling by the machinations of operators seeking to enrich themselves and destroy their<br/>enemies. Among the theatrical aspects of this particular battle—a battle so celebrated in its time that<br/>headline writers referred to it simply as the “Piggly Crisis”—was the personality of the hero (or, as<br/>some people saw it, the villain), who was a newcomer to Wall Street, a country boy setting out<br/>defiantly, amid the cheers of a good part of rural America, to lay the slick manipulators of New York<br/>by the heels. He was Clarence Saunders, of Memphis, a plump, neat, handsome man of forty-one who<br/>was already something of a legend in his home town, chiefly because of a house he was putting up<br/>there for himself. Called the Pink Palace, it was an enormous structure faced with pink Georgia<br/>marble and built around an awe-inspiring white-marble Roman atrium, and, according to Saunders, it<br/>would stand for a thousand years. Unfinished though it was, the Pink Palace was like nothing</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Memphis had ever seen before. Its grounds were to include a private golf course, since Saunders<br/>liked to do his golfing in seclusion. Even the makeshift estate where he and his wife and four children<br/>were camping out pending completion of the Palace had its own golf course. (Some people said that<br/>his preference for privacy was induced by the attitude of the local country club governors, who<br/>complained that he had corrupted their entire supply of caddies by the grandeur of his tips.) Saunders,<br/>who had founded the Piggly Wiggly Stores in 1919, had most of the standard traits of the flamboyant<br/>American promoters—suspect generosity, a knack for attracting publicity, love of ostentation, and so<br/>on—but he also had some much less common traits, notably a remarkably vivid style, both in speech<br/>and writing, and a gift, of which he may or may not have been aware, for comedy. But like so many<br/>great men before him, he had a weakness, a tragic flaw. It was that he insisted on thinking of himself<br/>as a hick, a boob, and a sucker, and, in doing so, he sometimes became all three.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This unlikely fellow was the man who engineered the last real corner in a nationally traded stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark252">THE </a><span class="p">game of Corner—for in its heyday it was a game, a high-stakes gambling game, pure and simple,<br/>embodying a good many of the characteristics of poker—was one phase of the endless Wall Street<br/>contest between bulls, who want the price of a stock to go up, and bears, who want it to go down.<br/>When a game of Corner was under way, the bulls’ basic method of operation was, of course, to buy<br/>stock, and the bears’ was to sell it. Since the average bear didn’t own any of the stock issue in<br/>contest, he would resort to the common practice of selling short. When a short sale is made, the<br/>transaction is consummated with stock that the seller has borrowed (at a suitable rate of interest) from<br/>a broker. Since brokers are merely agents, and not outright owners, they, in turn, must borrow the<br/>stock themselves. This they do by tapping the “floating supply” of stock that is in constant circulation<br/>among investment houses—stock that private investors have left with one house or another for trading<br/>purposes, stock that is owned by estates and trusts and has been released for action under certain<br/>prescribed conditions, and so on. In essence, the floating supply consists of all the stock in a<br/>particular corporation that is available for trading and is not immured in a safe-deposit box or<br/>encased in a mattress. Though the supply floats, it is scrupulously kept track of; the short seller,<br/>borrowing, say, a thousand shares from his broker, knows that he has incurred an immutable debt.<br/>What he hopes—the hope that keeps him alive—is that the market price of the stock will go down,<br/>enabling him to buy the thousand shares he owes at a bargain rate, pay off his debt, and pocket the<br/>difference. What he risks is that the lender, for one reason or another, may demand that he deliver up<br/>his thousand borrowed shares at a moment when their market price is at a high. Then the grinding truth<br/>of the old Wall Street jingle is borne in upon him: “He who sells what isn’t his’n must buy it back or<br/>go to prison.” And in the days when corners were possible, the short seller’s sleep was further<br/>disturbed by the fact that he was operating behind blank walls; dealing only with agents, he never<br/>knew either the identity of the purchaser of his stock (a prospective cornerer?) or the identity of the<br/>owner of the stock he had borrowed (the same prospective cornerer, attacking from the rear?).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark253"><span>Although it is sometimes condemned as being the tool of the speculator, short selling is still<br/>sanctioned, in a severely restricted form, on all of the nation’s exchanges. In its unfettered state, it<br/>was the standard gambit in the game of Corner. The situation would be set up when a group of bears<br/>would go on a well-organized spree of short selling, and would often help their cause along by<br/>spreading rumors that the company back of the stock in question was on its last legs. This operation<br/>was called a bear raid. The bulls’ most formidable—but, of course, riskiest—counter-move was to<br/>try for a corner. Only a stock that many traders were selling short could be cornered; a stock that was<br/>in the throes of a real bear raid was ideal. In the latter situation, the would-be cornerer would attempt</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>to buy up the investment houses’ floating supply of the stock and enough of the privately held shares to<br/>freeze out the bears; if the attempt succeeded, when he called for the short sellers to make good the<br/>stock they had borrowed, they could buy it from no one but him. And they would have to buy it at any<br/>price he chose to ask, their only alternatives—at least theoretically—being to go into bankruptcy or to<br/>jail for failure to meet their obligations.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark254"><span>In the old days of titanic financial death struggles, when Adam Smith’s ghost still smiled on Wall<br/>Street, corners were fairly common and were often extremely sanguinary, with hundreds of innocent<br/>bystanders, as well as the embattled principals, getting their financial heads lopped off. The most<br/>famous cornerer in history was that celebrated old pirate, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who<br/>engineered no less than three successful corners during the eighteen-sixties. Probably his classic job<br/>was in the stock of the Harlem Railway. By dint of secretly buying up all its available shares while<br/>simultaneouslycirculating a series of untruthful rumors of imminent bankruptcy to lure the short<br/>sellers in, he achieved an airtight trap. Finally, with the air of a man doing them a favor by saving<br/>them from jail, he offered the cornered shorts at $179 a share the stock he had bought up at a small<br/>fraction of that figure. The most generally disastrous corner was that of 1901 in the stock of Northern<br/>Pacific; to raise the huge quantities of cash they needed to cover themselves, the Northern Pacific<br/>shorts sold so many other stocks as to cause a national panic with world-wide repercussions. The<br/>next-to-last great corner occurred in 1920, when Allan A. Ryan, a son of the legendary Thomas<br/>Fortune Ryan, in order to harass his enemies in the New York Stock Exchange, sought to corner the<br/>stock of the Stutz Motor Company, makers of the renowned Stutz Bearcat. Ryan achieved his corner<br/>and the Stock Exchange short sellers were duly squeezed. But Ryan, it turned out, had a bearcat by the<br/>tail. The Stock Exchange suspended Stutz dealings, lengthy litigation followed, and Ryan came out of<br/>the affair financially ruined.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Then, as at other times, the game of Corner suffered from a difficulty that plagues other games—<br/>post-mortem disputes about the rules. The reform legislation of the nineteen-thirties, by outlawing any<br/>short selling that is specifically intended to demoralize a stock, as well as other manipulations<br/>leading toward corners, virtually ruled the game out of existence. Wall Streeters who speak of the<br/>Corner these days are referring to the intersection of Broad and Wall. In U.S. stock markets, only an<br/>accidental corner (or near-corner, like the Bruce one) is now possible; Clarence Saunders was the<br/>last intentional player of the game.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SAUNDERS <span class="p">has been variously characterized by people who knew him well as “a man of limitless<br/>imagination and energy,” “arrogant and conceited as all getout,” “essentially a four-year-old child,<br/>playing at things,” and “one of the most remarkable men of his generation.” But there is no doubt that<br/>even many of the people who lost money on his promotional schemes believed that he was the soul of<br/>honesty. He was born in 1881 to a poor family in Amherst County, Virginia, and in his teens was<br/>employed by the local grocer at the pittance that is orthodox for future tycoons taking on their first<br/>jobs—in his case, four dollars a week. Moving ahead fast, he went on to a wholesale grocery<br/>company in Clarksville, Tennessee, and then to one in Memphis, and, while still in his twenties,<br/>organized a small retail food chain called United Stores. He sold that after a few years, did a stint as<br/>a wholesale grocer on his own, and then, in 1919, began to build a chain of retail self-service<br/>markets, to which he gave the engaging name of Piggly Wiggly Stores. (When a Memphis business<br/>associate once asked him why he had chosen that name, he replied, “So people would ask me what<br/>you just did.”) The stores flourished so exuberantly that by the autumn of 1922 there were over<br/>twelve hundred of them. Of these, some six hundred and fifty were owned outright by Saunders’</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark255"><span>Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc.; the rest were independently owned, but their owners paid royalties to the<br/>parent company for the right to adopt its patented method of operations. In 1923, an era when a<br/>grocery store meant clerks in white aprons and often a thumb on the scale, this method was described<br/>by the </span></a><i>New York Times </i><span>with astonishment: “The customer in a Piggly Wiggly Store rambles down<br/>aisle after aisle, on both sides of which are shelves. The customer collects his purchases and pays as<br/>he goes out.” Although Saunders did not know it, he had invented the supermarket.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>A natural concomitant of the rapid rise of Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., was the acceptance of its<br/>shares for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and within six months of that event Piggly Wiggly<br/>stock had become known as a dependable, if unsensational, dividend-payer—the kind of widows’-<br/>and-orphans’ stock that speculators regard with the respectful indifference that crap-shooters feel<br/>about bridge. This reputation, however, was shortlived. In November, 1922, several small companies<br/>that had been operating grocery stores in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut under the name<br/>Piggly Wiggly failed and went into receivership. These companies had scarcely any connection with<br/>Saunders’ concern; he had merely sold them the right to use his firm’s catchy trade name, leased them<br/>some patented equipment, and washed his hands of them. But when these independent Piggly Wigglys<br/>failed, a group of stock-market operators (whose identities never were revealed, because they dealt<br/>through tight-lipped brokers) saw in the situation a heaven-sent opportunity for a bear raid. If<br/>individual Piggly Wiggly stores were failing, they reasoned, then rumors could be spread that would<br/>lead the uninformed public to believe that the parent firm was failing, too. To further this belief, they<br/>began briskly selling Piggly Wiggly short, in order to force the price down. The stock yielded readily<br/>to their pressure, and within a few weeks its price, which earlier in the year had hovered around fifty<br/>dollars a share, dropped to below forty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark256"><span>At this point, Saunders announced to the press that he was about to “beat the Wall Street<br/>professionals at their own game” with a buying campaign. He was by no means a professional<br/>himself; in fact, prior to the listing of Piggly Wiggly he had never owned a single share of any stock<br/>quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. There is little reason to believe that at the beginning of his<br/>buying campaign he had any intention of trying for a corner; it seems more likely that his announced<br/>motive—the unassailable one of supporting the price of the stock in order to protect his own<br/>investment and that of other Piggly Wiggly stockholders—was all he had in mind. In any case, he took<br/>on the bears with characteristic zest, supplementing his own funds with a loan of about ten million<br/>dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga, and St. Louis.<br/>Legend has it that he stuffed his ten million-plus, in bills of large denomination, into a suitcase,<br/>boarded a train for New York, and, his pockets bulging with currency that wouldn’t fit in the suitcase,<br/>marched on Wall Street, ready to do battle. He emphatically denied this in later years, insisting that<br/>he had remained in Memphis and masterminded his campaign by means of telegrams and long-<br/>distance telephone calls to various Wall Street brokers. Wherever he was at the time, he did round up<br/>a corps of some twenty brokers, among them Jesse L. Livermore, who served as his chief of staff.<br/>Livermore, one of the most celebrated American speculators of this century, was then forty-five years<br/>old but was still occasionally, and derisively, referred to by the nickname he had earned a couple of<br/>decades earlier—the Boy Plunger of Wall Street. Since Saunders regarded Wall Streeters in general<br/>and speculators in particular as parasitic scoundrels intent only on battering down his stock, it<br/>seemed likely that his decision to make an ally of Livermore was a reluctant one, arrived at simply<br/>with the idea of getting the enemy chieftain into his own camp.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On the first day of his duel with the bears, Saunders, operating behind his mask of brokers, bought<br/>33,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, mostly from the short sellers; within a week he had brought the total</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark257"><span>to 105,000—more than half of the 200,000 shares outstanding. Meanwhile, ventilating his emotions at<br/>the cost of tipping his hand, he began running a series of advertisements in which he vigorously and<br/>pungently told the readers of Southern and Western newspapers what he thought of Wall Street. “Shall<br/>the gambler rule?” he demanded in one of these effusions. “On a white horse he rides. Bluff is his<br/>coat of mail and thus shielded is a yellow heart. His helmet is deceit, his spurs clink with treachery,<br/>and the hoofbeats of his horse thunder destruction. Shall good business flee? Shall it tremble with<br/>fear? Shall it be the loot of the speculator?” On Wall Street, Livermore went on buying Piggly<br/>Wiggly.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The effectiveness of Saunders’ buying campaign was readily apparent; by late January of 1923 it<br/>had driven the price of the stock up over 60, or higher than ever before. Then, to intensify the bear<br/>raiders’ jitters, reports came in from Chicago, where the stock was also traded, that Piggly Wiggly<br/>was cornered—that the short sellers could not replace the stock they had borrowed without coming to<br/>Saunders for supplies. The reports were immediately denied by the New York Stock Exchange,<br/>which announced that the floating supply of Piggly Wiggly was ample, but they may have put an idea<br/>into Saunders’ head, and this, in turn, may have prompted a curious and—at first glance—mystifying<br/>move he made in mid-February, when, in another widely disseminated newspaper advertisement, he<br/>offered to </span><i>sell </i><span>fifty thousand shares of Piggly Wiggly stock to the public at fifty-five dollars a share.<br/>The ad pointed out, persuasively enough, that the stock was paying a dividend of a dollar four times a<br/>year—a return of more than 7 percent. “This is to be a quick proposition, subject to withdrawal<br/>without prior notice,” the ad went on, calmly but urgently. “To get in on the ground floor of any big<br/>proposition is the opportunity that comes to few, and then only once in a lifetime.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Anyone who is even slightly familiar with modern economic life can scarcely help wondering what<br/>the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is charged with seeing to it that all financial<br/>advertising is kept factual, impersonal, and unemotional, would have had to say about the hard sell in<br/>those last two sentences. But if Saunders’ first stock-offering ad would have caused an S.E.C.<br/>examiner to turn pale, his second, published four days later, might well have induced an apoplectic<br/>seizure. A full-page affair, it cried out, in huge black type:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">OPPORTUNITY<span class="s7">!</span><span class="p"> </span>OPPORTUNITY<span class="s7">!</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It Knocks!

To many people, though, it appeared that<br/>Saunders was being generous to the point of folly. The price of Piggly Wiggly on the New York Stock<br/>Exchange was just then pushing 70; it looked as if Saunders were handing anyone who had fifty-five<br/>dollars in his pocket a chance to make fifteen dollars with no risk. The arrival of a new Daniel,<br/>Joseph, or Moses might be debatable, but opportunity certainly did seem to be knocking, all right.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Actually, as the skeptical must have suspected, there was a catch. In making what sounded like such<br/>a costly and unbusinesslike offer, Saunders, a rank novice at Corner, had devised one of the craftiest</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>dodges ever used in the game. One of the great hazards in Corner was always that even though a<br/>player might defeat his opponents, he would discover that he had won a Pyrrhic victory. Once the<br/>short sellers had been squeezed dry, that is, the cornerer might find that the reams of stock he had<br/>accumulated in the process were a dead weight around his neck; by pushing it all back into the market<br/>in one shove, he would drive its price down close to zero. And if, like Saunders, he had had to<br/>borrow heavily to get into the game in the first place, his creditors could be expected to close in on<br/>him and perhaps not only divest him of his gains but drive him into bankruptcy. Saunders apparently<br/>anticipated this hazard almost as soon as a corner was in sight, and accordingly made plans to unload<br/>some of his stock before winning instead of afterward. His problem was to keep the stock he sold<br/>from going right back into the floating supply, thus breaking his corner; and his solution was to sell<br/>his fifty-five-dollar shares on the installment plan. In his February advertisements, he stipulated that<br/>the public could buy shares only by paying twenty-five dollars down and the balance in three ten-<br/>dollar installments, due June 1st, September 1st, and December 1st. In addition—and vastly more<br/>important—he said he would not turn over the stock certificates to the buyers until the final<br/>installment had been paid. Since the buyers obviously couldn’t sell the certificates until they had<br/>them, the stock could not be used to replenish the floating supply. Thus Saunders had until December<br/>1st to squeeze the short sellers dry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Easy as it may be to see through Saunders’ plan by hindsight, his maneuver was then so unorthodox<br/>that for a while neither the governors of the Stock Exchange nor Livermore himself could be quite<br/>sure what the man in Memphis was up to. The Stock Exchange began making formal inquiries, and<br/>Livermore began getting skittish, but he went on buying for Saunders’ account, and succeeded in<br/>pushing Piggly Wiggly’s price up well above 70. In Memphis, Saunders sat back comfortably; he<br/>temporarily ceased singing the praises of Piggly Wiggly stock in his ads, and devoted them to<br/>eulogizing apples, grapefruit, onions, hams, and Lady Baltimore cakes. Early in March, though, he ran<br/>another financial ad, repeating his stock offer and inviting any readers who wanted to discuss it with<br/>him to drop in at his Memphis office. He also emphasized that quick action was necessary; time was<br/>running out.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark258"><span>By now, it was apparent that Saunders was trying for a corner, and on Wall Street it was not only<br/>the Piggly Wiggly bears who were becoming apprehensive. Finally, Livermore, possibly reflecting<br/>that in 1908 he had lost almost a million dollars trying to get a corner in cotton, could stand it no<br/>longer. He demanded that Saunders come to New York and talk things over. Saunders arrived on the<br/>morning of March 12th. As he later described the meeting to reporters, there was a difference of<br/>opinion; Livermore, he said—and his tone was that of a man rather set up over having made a piker<br/>out of the Boy Plunger—“gave me the impression that he was a little afraid of my financial situation<br/>and that he did not care to be involved in any market crash.” The upshot of the conference was that<br/>Livermore bowed out of the Piggly Wiggly operation, leaving Saunders to run it by himself. Saunders<br/>then boarded a train for Chicago to attend to some business there. At Albany, he was handed a<br/>telegram from a member of the Stock Exchange who was the nearest thing he had to a friend in the<br/>white-charger-and-coat-of-mail set. The telegram informed him that his antics had provoked a great<br/>deal of head-shaking in the councils of the Exchange, and urged him to stop creating a second market<br/>by advertising stock for sale at a price so far below the quotation on the Exchange. At the next station,<br/>Saunders telegraphed back a rather unresponsive reply. If it was a possible corner the Exchange was<br/>fretting about, he said, he could assure the governors that they could put their fears aside, since he<br/>himself was maintaining the floating supply by daily offering stock for loan in any amount desired.<br/>But he didn’t say how long he would continue to do so.</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>A week later, on Monday, March 19th, Saunders ran a newspaper ad stating that his stock offer<br/>was about to be withdrawn; this was the last call. At the time, or so he claimed afterward, he had<br/>acquired all but 1,128 of Piggly Wiggly’s 200,000 outstanding shares, for a total of 198,872, some of<br/>which he owned and the rest of which he “controlled”—a reference to the installment-plan shares<br/>whose certificates he still held. Actually, this figure was open to considerable argument (there was<br/>one private investor in Providence, for instance, who alone held eleven hundred shares), but there is<br/>no denying that Saunders had in his hands practically every single share of Piggly Wiggly then<br/>available for trading—and that he therefore had his corner. On that same Monday, it is believed,<br/>Saunders telephoned Livermore and asked if he would relent long enough to see the Piggly Wiggly<br/>project through by calling for delivery of all the shares that were owed Saunders; in other words,<br/>would Livermore please spring the trap? Nothing doing, Livermore is supposed to have replied,<br/>evidently considering himself well out of the whole affair. So the following morning, Tuesday, March<br/>20th, Saunders sprang the trap himself.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark259">IT </a><span class="p">turned out to be one of Wall Street’s wilder days. Piggly Wiggly opened at 75½, up 5½ from the<br/>previous days’ closing price. An hour after the opening, word arrived that Saunders had called for<br/>delivery of all his Piggly Wiggly stock. According to the rules of the Exchange, stock called for under<br/>such circumstances had to be produced by two-fifteen the following afternoon. But Piggly Wiggly, as<br/>Saunders well knew, simply wasn’t to be had—except, of course, from him. To be sure, there were a<br/>few shares around that were still held by private investors, and frantic short sellers trying to shake<br/>them loose bid their price up and up. But by and large there wasn’t much actual trading in Piggly<br/>Wiggly, because there was so little Piggly Wiggly to be traded. The Stock Exchange post where it<br/>was bought and sold became the center of a mob scene as two-thirds of the brokers on the floor<br/>clustered around it, a few of them to bid but most of them just to push, whoop, and otherwise get in on<br/>the excitement. Desperate short sellers bought Piggly Wiggly at 90, then at 100, then at 110. Reports<br/>of sensational profits made the rounds. The Providence investor, who had picked up his eleven<br/>hundred shares at 39 in the previous autumn, while the bear raid was in full cry, came to town to be in<br/>on the kill, unloaded his holdings at an average price of 105, and then caught an afternoon train back<br/>home, taking with him a profit of over seventy thousand dollars. As it happened, he could have done<br/>even better if he had bided his time; by noon, or a little after, the price of Piggly Wiggly had risen to<br/>124, and it seemed destined to zoom straight through the lofty roof above the traders’ heads. But 124<br/>was as high as it went, for that figure had barely been recorded when a rumor reached the floor that<br/>the governors of the Exchange were meeting to consider the suspension of further trading in the stock<br/>and the postponement of the short sellers’ deadline for delivery. The effect of such action would be to<br/>give the bears time to beat the bushes for stock, and thus to weaken, if not break, Saunders’ corner.<br/>On the basis of the rumor alone, Piggly Wiggly fell to 82 by the time the Exchange’s closing bell<br/>ended the chaotic session.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The rumor proved to be true. After the close of business, the Governing Committee of the Exchange<br/>announced both the suspension of trading in Piggly Wiggly and the extension of the short sellers’<br/>delivery deadline “until further action by this committee.” There was no immediate official reason<br/>given for this decision, but some members of the committee unofficially let it be known that they had<br/>been afraid of a repetition of the Northern Pacific panic if the corner were not broken. On the other<br/>hand, irreverent side-liners were inclined to wonder whether the Governing Committee had not been<br/>moved by the pitiful plight of the cornered short sellers, many of whom—as in the Stutz Motor case<br/>two years earlier—were believed to be members of the Exchange.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Despite all this, Saunders, in Memphis, was in a jubilant, expansive mood that Tuesday evening.<br/>After  all, his paper profits at that moment ran to several million dollars. The hitch, of course, was that<br/>he could not realize them, but he seems to have been slow to grasp that fact or to understand the extent<br/>to which his position had been undermined. The indications are that he went to bed convinced that,<br/>besides having personally brought about a first-class mess on the hated Stock Exchange, he had made<br/>himself a bundle and had demonstrated how a poor Southern boy could teach the city slickers a<br/>lesson. It all must have added up to a heady sensation. But, like most such sensations, it didn’t last<br/>long. By Wednesday evening, when Saunders issued his first public utterance on the Piggly Crisis, his<br/>mood had changed to an odd mixture of puzzlement, defiance, and a somewhat muted echo of the<br/>crowing triumph of the night before. “A razor to my throat, figuratively speaking, is why I suddenly<br/>and without warning kicked the pegs from under Wall Street and its gang of gamblers and market<br/>manipulators,” he declared in a press interview. “It was strictly a question of whether I should<br/>survive, and likewise my business and the fortunes of my friends, or whether I should be ‘licked’ and<br/>pointed to as a boob from Tennessee. And the consequence was that the boastful and supposedly<br/>invulnerable Wall Street powers found their methods controverted by well-laid plans and quick<br/>action.” Saunders wound up his statement by laying down his terms: the Stock Exchange’s deadline<br/>extension notwithstanding, he would expect settlement in full on all short stock by 3 </span><span class="s6">P.M. </span>the next day</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—Thursday—at $150 a share; thereafter his price would be $250.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark260"><span>On Thursday, to Saunders’ surprise, very few short sellers came forward to settle; presumably<br/>those who did couldn’t stand the uncertainty. But then the Governing Committee kicked the pegs from<br/>under Saunders by announcing that the stock of Piggly Wiggly was permanently stricken from its<br/>trading list and that the short sellers would be given a full five days from the original deadline—that<br/>is, until two-fifteen the following Monday—to meet their obligations. In Memphis, Saunders, far<br/>removed from the scene though he was, could not miss the import of these moves—he was now on the<br/>losing end of things. Nor could he any longer fail to see that the postponement of the short sellers’<br/>deadline was the vital issue. “As I understand it,” he said in another statement, handed to reporters<br/>that evening, “the failure of a broker to meet his clearings through the Stock Exchange at the appointed<br/>time is the same as a bank that would be unable to meet its clearings, and all of us know what would<br/>happen to that kind of a bank.… The bank examiner would have a sign stuck up on the door with the<br/>word ‘Closed.’ It is unbelievable to me that the august and all-powerful New York Stock Exchange is<br/>a welcher. Therefore I continue to believe that the … shares of stock still due me on contracts … will<br/>be settled on the proper basis.” An editorial in the Memphis </span></a><i>Commercial Appeal </i><span>backed up<br/>Saunders’ cry of treachery, declaring, “This looks like what gamblers call welching. We hope the<br/>home boy beats them to a frazzle.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>That same Thursday, by a coincidence, the annual financial report of Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc.,<br/>was made public. It was a highly favorable one—sales, profits, current assets, and all other<br/>significant figures were up sharply over the year before—but nobody paid any attention to it. For the<br/>moment, the real worth of the company was irrelevant; the point was the game.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ON <span class="p">Friday morning, the Piggly Wiggly bubble burst. It burst because Saunders, who had said his price<br/>would rise to $250 a share after 3 </span>P.M. <span class="p">Thursday, made the startling announcement that he would settle<br/>for a hundred. E. W. Bradford, Saunders’ New York lawyer, was asked why Saunders had suddenly<br/>granted this striking concession. Saunders had done it out of the generosity of his heart, Bradford<br/>replied gamely, but the truth was soon obvious: Saunders had made the concession because he’d had<br/>to. The postponement granted by the Stock Exchange had given the short sellers and their brokers a</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>chance to scan lists of Piggly Wiggly stockholders, and from these they had been able to smoke out<br/>small blocks of shares that Saunders had not cornered. Widows and orphans in Albuquerque and<br/>Sioux City, who knew nothing about short sellers and corners, were only too happy, when pressed, to<br/>dig into their mattresses or safe-deposit boxes and sell—in the so-called over-the-counter market,<br/>since the stock could no longer be traded on the Exchange—their ten or twenty shares of Piggly<br/>Wiggly for at least double what they had paid for them. Consequently, instead of having to buy stock<br/>from Saunders at his price of $250 and then hand it back to him in settlement of their loans, many of<br/>the short sellers were able to buy it in over-the-counter trading at around a hundred dollars, and thus,<br/>with bitter pleasure, pay off their Memphis adversary not in cash but in shares of Piggly Wiggly—the<br/>very last thing he wanted just then. By nightfall Friday, virtually all the short sellers were in the clear,<br/>having redeemed their indebtedness either by these over-the-counter purchases or by paying Saunders<br/>cash at his own suddenly deflated rate of a hundred dollars a share.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>That evening, Saunders released still another statement, and this one, while still defiant, was<br/>unmistakably a howl of anguish. “Wall Street got licked and then called for ‘mamma,’” it read. “Of<br/>all the institutions in America, the New York Stock Exchange is the worst menace of all in its power<br/>to ruin all who dare to oppose it. A law unto itself … an association of men who claim the right that<br/>no king or autocrat ever dared to take: to make a rule that applies one day on contracts and abrogate it<br/>the next day to let out a bunch of welchers.… My whole life from this day on will be aimed toward<br/>the end of having the public protected from a like occurrence.… I am not afraid. Let Wall Street get<br/>me if they can.” But it appeared that Wall Street had got him; his corner was broken, leaving him<br/>deeply in debt to the syndicate of Southern bankers and encumbered with a mountain of stock whose<br/>immediate future was, to say the least, precarious.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark261">SAUNDEES’ </a><span class="p">fulminations did not go unheeded on Wall Street, and as a result the  Exchange felt<br/>compelled to justify itself. On Monday, March 26th, shortly after the Piggly Wiggly short sellers’<br/>deadline had passed and Saunders’ corner was, for all practical purposes, a dead issue, the Exchange<br/>offered its apologia, in the form of a lengthy review of the crisis from beginning to end. In presenting<br/>its case, the Exchange emphasized the public harm that might have been done if the corner had gone<br/>unbroken, explaining, “The enforcement simultaneously of all contracts for the return of the stock<br/>would have forced the stock to any price that might be fixed by Mr. Saunders, and competitive<br/>bidding for the insufficient supply might have brought about conditions illustrated by other corners,<br/>notably the Northern Pacific corner in 1901.” Then, its syntax yielding to its sincerity, the Exchange<br/>went on to say that “the demoralizing effects of such a situation are not limited to those directly<br/>affected by the contracts but extends to the whole market.” Getting down to the two specific actions it<br/>had taken—the suspension of trading in Piggly Wiggly and the extension of the short sellers’ deadline</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—the Exchange argued that both of them were within the bounds of its own constitution and rules, and<br/>therefore irreproachable. Arrogant as this may sound now, the Exchange had a point; in those days its<br/>rules were just about the only controls over stock trading.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The question of whether, even by their own rules, the slickers really played fair with the boob is<br/>still debated among fiscal antiquarians. There is strong presumptive evidence that the slickers<br/>themselves later came to have their doubts. Regarding the right of the Exchange to suspend trading in<br/>a stock there can be no argument, since the right was, as the Exchange claimed at the time,<br/>specifically granted in its constitution. But the right to postpone the deadline for short sellers to honor<br/>their contracts, though also claimed at the time, is another matter. In June, 1925, two years after<br/>Saunders’ corner, the Exchange felt constrained to amend its constitution with an article stating that</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark262"><span>“whenever in the opinion of the Governing Committee a corner has been created in a security listed<br/>on the Exchange … the Governing Committee may postpone the time for deliveries on Exchange<br/>contracts therein.” By adopting a statute authorizing it to do what it had done long before, the<br/>Exchange would seem, at the very least, to have exposed a guilty conscience.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">THE </span><span>immediate aftermath of the Piggly Crisis was a wave of sympathy for Saunders. Throughout the<br/>hinterland, the public image of him became that of a gallant champion of the underdog who had been<br/>ruthlessly crushed. Even in New York, the very lair of the Stock Exchange, the </span><i>Times </i><span>conceded in an<br/>editorial that in the minds of many people Saunders represented St. George and the Stock Exchange<br/>the dragon. That the dragon triumphed in the end, said the </span><i>Times</i><span>, was “bad news for a nation at least<br/>66⅔ per cent ‘sucker,’ which had its moment of triumph when it read that a sucker had trimmed the<br/>interests and had his foot on Wall Street’s neck while the vicious manipulators gasped their lives<br/>away.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Not a man to ignore such a host of friendly fellow suckers, Saunders went to work to turn them to<br/>account. And he needed them, for his position was perilous indeed. His biggest problem was what to<br/>do about the ten million dollars that he owed his banker backers—and didn’t have. The basic plan<br/>behind his corner—if he had had any plan at all—must have been to make such a killing that he could<br/>pay back a big slice of his debt out of the profits, pay back the rest out of the proceeds from his public<br/>stock sale, and then walk off with a still huge block of Piggly Wiggly stock free and clear. Even<br/>though the cut-rate hundred-dollar settlement had netted him a killing by most men’s standards (just<br/>how much of a killing is not known, but it has been reliably estimated at half a million or so), it was<br/>not a fraction of what he might have reasonably expected it to be, and because it wasn’t his whole<br/>structure became an arch without a keystone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark263"><span>Having paid his bankers what he had received from the short sellers and from his public stock sale,<br/>Saunders found that he still owed them about five million dollars, half of it due September 1, 1923,<br/>and the balance on January 1, 1924. His best hope of raising the money lay in selling more of the vast<br/>bundle of Piggly Wiggly shares he still had on hand. Since he could no longer sell them on the<br/>Exchange, he resorted to his favorite form of self-expression—newspaper advertising, this time<br/>supplemented with a mail-order pitch offering Piggly Wiggly again at fifty-five dollars. It soon<br/>became evident, though, that public sympathy was one thing and public willingness to translate<br/>sympathy into cash was quite another. Everyone, whether in New York, Memphis, or Texarkana,<br/>knew about the recent speculative shenanigans in Piggly Wiggly and about the dubious state of the<br/>president’s finances. Not even Saunders’ fellow suckers would have any part of his deal now, and the<br/>campaign was a bleak failure.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Sadly accepting this fact, Saunders next appealed to the local and regional pride of his Memphis<br/>neighbors by turning his remarkable powers of persuasion to the job of convincing them that his<br/>financial dilemma was a civic issue. If he should go broke, he argued, it would reflect not only on the<br/>character and business acumen of Memphis but on Southern honor in general. “I do not ask for<br/>charity,” he wrote in one of the large ads he always seemed able to find the cash for, “and I do not<br/>request any flowers for my financial funeral, but I do ask … everybody in Memphis to recognize and<br/>know that this is a serious statement made for the purpose of acquainting those who wish to assist in<br/>this matter, that they may work with me, and with other friends and believers in my business, in a<br/>Memphis campaign to have every man and woman who possibly can in this city become one of the<br/>partners of the Piggly Wiggly business, because it is a good investment first, and, second, because it<br/>is the right thing to do.” Raising his sights in a second ad, he declared, “For Piggly Wiggly to be</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ruined would shame the whole South.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark264"><span>Just which argument proved the clincher in persuading Memphis that it should try to pull Saunders’<br/>chestnutsout of the fire is hard to say, but some part of his line of reasoning clicked, and soon the<br/>Memphis </span></a><i>Commercial Appeal </i><span>was urging the town to get behind the embattled local boy. The<br/>response of the city’s business leaders was truly inspiring to Saunders. A whirlwind three-day<br/>campaign was planned, with the object of selling fifty thousand shares of his stock to the citizens of<br/>Memphis at the old magic figure of fifty-five dollars a share; in order to give buyers some degree of<br/>assurance that they would not later find themselves alone out on a limb, it was stipulated that unless<br/>the whole block was sold within the three days, all sales would be called off. The Chamber of<br/>Commerce sponsored the drive; the American Legion, the Civitan Club, and the Exchange Club fell<br/>into line; and even the Bowers Stores and the Arrow Stores, both competitors of Piggly Wiggly in<br/>Memphis, agreed to plug the worthy cause. Hundreds of civic-minded volunteers signed up to ring<br/>doorbells. On May 3rd, five days before the scheduled start of the campaign, 250 Memphis<br/>businessmen assembled at the Gayoso Hotel for a kickoff dinner. There were cheers when Saunders,<br/>accompanied by his wife, entered the dining room; one of the many after-dinner speakers described<br/>him as “the man who has done more for Memphis than any in the last thousand years”—a rousing<br/>tribute that put God knew how many Chickasaw chiefs in their place. “Business rivalries and<br/>personal differences were swept away like mists before the sun,” a </span><i>Commercial Appeal </i><span>reporter<br/>wrote of the dinner.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The drive got off to a splendid start. On the opening day—May 8th—society women and Boy<br/>Scouts paraded the streets of Memphis wearing badges that read, “We’re One Hundred Per Cent for<br/>Clarence Saunders and Piggly Wiggly.” Merchants adorned their windows with placards bearing the<br/>slogan “A Share of Piggly Wiggly Stock in Every Home.” Telephones and doorbells rang incessantly.<br/>In short order, 23,698 of the 50,000 shares had been subscribed for. Yet at the very moment when<br/>most of Memphis had become miraculously convinced that the peddling of Piggly Wiggly stock was<br/>an activity fully as uplifting as soliciting for the Red Cross or the Community Chest, ugly doubts were<br/>brewing, and some vipers in the home nest suddenly demanded that Saunders consent to an immediate<br/>spot audit of his company’s books. Saunders, for whatever reasons, refused, but offered to placate the<br/>skeptics by stepping down as president of Piggly Wiggly if such a move “would facilitate the stock-<br/>selling campaign.” He was not asked to give up the presidency, but on May 9th, the second day of the<br/>campaign, a watchdog committee of four—three bankers and a businessman—was appointed by the<br/>Piggly Wiggly directors to help him run the company for an interim period, while the dust settled.<br/>That same day, Saunders was confronted with another embarrassing situation: why, the campaign<br/>leaders wanted to know, was he continuing to build his million-dollar Pink Palace at a time when the<br/>whole town was working for him for nothing? He replied hastily that he would have the place<br/>boarded up the very next day and that there would be no further construction until his financial future<br/>looked bright again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The confusion attendant on these two issues brought the drive to a standstill. At the end of the third<br/>day, the total number of shares subscribed for was still under 25,000, and the sales that had been<br/>made were canceled. Saunders had to admit that the drive had been a failure. “Memphis has fizzled,”<br/>he reportedly added—although he was at great pains to deny this a few years later, when he needed<br/>more of Memphis’ money for a new venture. It would not be surprising, though, if he had made some<br/>such imprudent remark, for he was understandably suffering from a case of frazzled nerves, and was<br/>showing the strain. Just before the announcement of the campaign’s unhappy end, he went into a<br/>closed conference with several Memphis business leaders and came out of it with a bruised</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>cheekbone and a torn collar. None of the other men at the meeting showed any marks of violence. It<br/>just wasn’t Saunders’ day.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark265"><span>Although it was never established that Saunders had had his hand improperly in the Piggly Wiggly<br/>corporate till during his cornering operation, his first business move after the collapse of his attempt<br/>to unload stock suggested that he had at least had good reason to refuse a spot audit of the company’s<br/>books. In spite of futile grunts of protest from the watchdog committee, he began selling not Piggly<br/>Wiggly stock but Piggly Wiggly stores—partly liquidating the company, that is—and no one knew<br/>where he would stop. The Chicago stores went first, and those in Denver and Kansas City soon<br/>followed. His announced intention was to build up the company’s treasury so that </span></a><i>it </i><span>could buy the<br/>stock that the public had spurned, but there was some suspicion that the treasury desperately needed a<br/>transfusion just then—and not of Piggly Wiggly stock, either. “I’ve got Wall Street and the whole gang<br/>licked,” Saunders reported cheerfully in June. But in mid-August, with the September 1st deadline for<br/>repayment of two and a half million dollars on his loan staring him in the face and with nothing like<br/>that amount of cash either on hand or in prospect, he resigned as president of Piggly Wiggly Stores,<br/>Inc., and turned over his assets—his stock in the company, his Pink Palace, and all the rest of his<br/>property—to his creditors.</span><a name="bookmark266">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>It remained only for the formal stamp of failure to be put on Saunders personally and on Piggly<br/>Wiggly under his management. On August 22nd, the New York auction firm of Adrian H. Muller &amp;<br/>Son, which dealt in so many next-to-worthless stocks that its salesroom was often called “the<br/>securities graveyard,” knocked down fifteen hundred shares of Piggly Wiggly at a dollar a share—the<br/>traditional price for securities that have been run into the ground—and the following spring Saunders<br/>went through formal bankruptcy proceedings. But these were anticlimaxes. The real low point of<br/>Saunders’ career was probably the day he was forced out of his company’s presidency, and it was<br/>then  that, in the opinion of many of his admirers, he achieved his rhetorical peak. When he emerged,<br/>harassed but still defiant, from a directors’ conference and announced his resignation to reporters, a<br/>hush fell. Then Saunders added hoarsely, “They have the body of Piggly Wiggly, but they cannot have<br/>the soul.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark267">IF </a><span class="p">by the soul of Piggly Wiggly Saunders meant himself, then it did remain free—free to go marching<br/>on in its own erratic way. He never ventured to play another game of Corner, but his spirit was far<br/>from broken. Although officially bankrupt, he managed to find people of truly rocklike faith who were<br/>still willing to finance him, and they enabled him to live on a scale only slightly less grand than in the<br/>past; reduced to playing golf at the Memphis Country Club rather than on his own private course, he<br/>handed out caddy tips that the club governors considered as corrupting as ever. To be sure, he no<br/>longer owned the Pink Palace, but this was about the only evidence that served to remind his fellow<br/>townsmen of his misfortunes. Eventually, the unfinished pleasure dome came into the hands of the city<br/>of Memphis, which appropriated $150,000 to finish it and turn it into a museum of natural history and<br/>industrial arts. As such, it continues to sustain the Saunders legend in Memphis.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>After his downfall, Saunders spent the better part of three years in seeking redress of the wrongs<br/>that he felt he had suffered in the Piggly Wiggly fight, and in foiling the efforts of his enemies and<br/>creditors to make things still more unpleasant for him. For a while, he kept threatening to sue the<br/>Stock Exchange for conspiracy and breach of contract, but a test suit, brought by some small Piggly<br/>Wiggly stockholders, failed, and he dropped the idea. Then, in January, 1926, he learned that a<br/>federal indictment was about to be brought against him for using the mails to defraud in his mail-order<br/>campaign to sell his Piggly Wiggly stock. He believed, incorrectly, that the government had been</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>egged on to bring the indictment by an old associate of his—John C. Burch, of Memphis, who had<br/>become secretary-treasurer of Piggly Wiggly after the shakeup. His patience once more exhausted,<br/>Saunders went around to Piggly Wiggly headquarters and confronted Burch. This conference proved<br/>far more satisfactory to Saunders than his board-room scuffle on the day the Memphis civic stock-<br/>selling drive failed. Burch, according to Saunders, “undertook in a stammering way to deny” the<br/>accusation, whereupon Saunders delivered a right to the jaw, knocking off Burch’s glasses but not<br/>doing much other damage. Burch afterward belittled the blow as “glancing,” and added an alibi that<br/>sounded like that of any outpointed pugilist: “The assault upon me was made so suddenly that I did<br/>not have time or opportunity to strike Mr. Saunders.” Burch refused to press charges.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark268"><span>About a month later, the mail-fraud indictment was brought against Saunders, but by that time,<br/>satisfied that Burch was innocent of any dirty work, he was his amiable old self again. “I have only<br/>one thing to regret in this new affair,” he announced pleasantly, “and that is my fistic encounter with<br/>John C. Burch.” The new affair didn’t last long; in April the indictment was quashed by the Memphis<br/>District Court, and Saunders and Piggly Wiggly were finally quits. By then, the company was well on<br/>its way back up, and, with a greatly changed corporate structure, it flourished on into the nineteen<br/>sixties; housewives continued to ramble down the aisles of hundreds of Piggly Wiggly stores, now<br/>operated under a franchise agreement with the Piggly Wiggly Corporation, of Jacksonville, Florida.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Saunders, too, was well on his way back up. In 1928, he started a new grocery chain, which he—<br/>but hardly anyone else—called the Clarence Saunders, Sole Owner of My Name, Stores, Inc. Its<br/>outlets soon came to be known as Sole Owner stores, which was precisely what they weren’t, for<br/>without Saunders’ faithful backers they would have existed only in his mind. Saunders’ choice of a<br/>corporate title, however, was not designed to mislead the public; rather, it was his ironic way of<br/>reminding the world that, after the skinning Wall Street had given him, his name was about the only<br/>thing he still had a clear title to. How many Sole Owner customers—or governors of the Stock<br/>Exchange, for that matter—got the point is questionable. In any case, the new stores caught on so<br/>rapidly and did so well that Saunders leaped back up from bankruptcy to riches, and bought a million-<br/>dollar estate just outside Memphis. He also organized and underwrote a professional football team<br/>called the Sole Owner Tigers—an investment that paid off handsomely on the fall afternoons when he<br/>could hear cries of “Rah! Rah! Rah! Sole Owner! Sole Owner! Sole Owner!” ringing through the<br/>Memphis Stadium.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark269">FOR </a><span class="p">the second time, Saunders’ glory was fleeting. The very first wave of the depression hit Sole<br/>Owner Stores such a crushing blow that in 1930 they went bankrupt, and he was broke again. But<br/>again he pulled himself together and survived the debacle. Finding backers, he planned a new chain<br/>of grocery stores, and thought up a name for it that was more outlandish, if possible, than either of its<br/>predecessors—Keedoozle. He never made another killing, however, or bought another million-dollar<br/>estate, though it was always clear that he expected to. His hopes were pinned on the Keedoozle, an<br/>electrically operated grocery store, and he spent the better part of the last twenty years of his life<br/>trying to perfect it. In a Keedoozle store, the merchandise was displayed behind glass panels, each<br/>with a slot beside it, like the food in an Automat. There the similarity ended, for, instead of inserting<br/>coins in the slot to open a panel and lift out a purchase, Keedoozle customers inserted a key that they<br/>were given on entering the store. Moreover, Saunders’ thinking had advanced far beyond the<br/>elementary stage of having the key open the panel; each time a Keedoozle key was inserted in a slot,<br/>the identity of the item selected was inscribed in code on a segment of recording tape embedded in<br/>the key itself, and simultaneously the item was automatically transferred to a conveyor belt that</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>carried it to an exit gate at the front of the store. When a customer had finished his shopping, he would<br/>present his key to an attendant at the gate, who would decipher the tape and add up the bill. As soon<br/>as this was paid, the purchases would be catapulted into the customer’s arms, all bagged and<br/>wrapped, by a device at the end of the conveyor belt.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>A couple of pilot Keedoozle stores were tried out—one in Memphis and the other in Chicago—but<br/>it was found  that the machinery was too complex and expensive to compete with supermarket<br/>pushcarts. Undeterred, Saunders set to work on an even more intricate mechanism—the Foodelectric,<br/>which would do everything the Keedoozle could do and add up the bill as well. It will never corner<br/>the retail-store-equipment market, though, because it was still unfinished when Saunders died, in<br/>October, 1953, five years too soon for him to see the Bruce “corner”, which, in any case, he would<br/>have been fully entitled to scoff at as a mere squabble among ribbon clerks.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark270">9</a><a name="bookmark271">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark272">A Second Sort of Life</a><a name="bookmark273">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark274"><span class="s6">DURING </span></a><span>Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Presidency, when Wall Street and Washington tended to be on cat-<br/>and-dog terms, perhaps no New Dealer other than That Man himself better typified the New Deal in<br/>the eyes of Wall Street than David Eli Lilienthal. The explanation of this estimate of him in southern<br/>Manhattan lay not in any specific anti-Wall Street acts of Lilienthal’s—indeed, the scattering of<br/>financiers, among them Wendell L. Willkie, who had personal dealings with him generally found him<br/>to        be a reasonable sort of fellow—but in what he had come to symbolize through his association with<br/>the Tennessee Valley Authority, which, as a government-owned electric-power concern far larger<br/>than any private power corporation in the country, embodied Wall Street’s notion of galloping<br/>Socialism. Because Lilienthal was a conspicuous and vigorous member of the T.V.A.’s three-man<br/>board of directors from 1933 until 1941, and was its chairman from 1941 until 1946, the business<br/>community of that period, in his phrase, thought he “wore horns.” In 1946, he became the first<br/>chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and when he gave up that position, in<br/>February, 1950, at the age of fifty, the </span><i>Times </i><span>said in a news story that he had been “perhaps the most<br/>controversial figure in Washington since the end of the war.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark275"><span>What has Lilienthal been up to in the years since he left the government? As a matter of public<br/>record,he has been up to a number of things, all of them, surprisingly, centered on Wall Street or on<br/>private business, or both. For one thing, Lilienthal is listed in any number of business compendiums<br/>as the co-founder and the chairman of the board of the Development &amp; Resources Corporation.<br/>Several years ago, I phoned D. &amp; R.’s offices, then at 50 Broadway, New York City, and discovered<br/>it      to be a private firm—Wall Street-backed as well as, give or take a block, Wall Street-based—that<br/>provides managerial, technical, business, and planning services toward the development of natural<br/>resources abroad. That is to say, D. &amp; R.—whose other co-founder, the late Gordon R. Clapp, was<br/>Lilienthal’s successor as T.V.A. chairman—is in the business of helping governments set up programs<br/>more or less similar to the T.V.A. Since its formation, in 1955, I learned, D. &amp; R. had, at moderate<br/>but gratifying profit to itself, planned and managed the beginnings of a vast scheme for the reclamation<br/>of Khuzistan, an arid and poverty-stricken, though oil-rich, region of western Iran; advised the<br/>government of Italy on the development of its backward southern provinces; helped the Republic of<br/>Colombia set up a T.V.A.-like authority for its potentially fertile but flood-plagued Cauca Valley; and<br/>offered advice to Ghana on water supply, to the Ivory Coast on mineral development, and to Puerto<br/>Rico on electric power and atomic energy.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>For another thing—and when I found out about this, it struck me as considerably more astonishing,<br/>on form, than D. &amp; R.—Lilienthal has made an authentic fortune as a corporate officer and<br/>entrepreneur. In a proxy statement of the Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation of America, dated June<br/>24, 1960, that fell into my hands, I found Lilienthal listed as a director of the firm and the holder of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>41,366 shares of its common stock. These shares at the time of my investigation were being traded on<br/>the New York Stock Exchange at something over twenty-five dollars each, and simple multiplication<br/>revealed that they represented a thumping sum by most men’s standards, certainly including those of a<br/>man who had spent most of his life on government wages, without the help of private resources.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And, for still another thing, in 1953 Harper &amp; Brothers brought out Lilienthal’s third book, “Big<br/>Business: A New Era.” (His previous books were “T.V.A.: Democracy on the March” and “This I<br/>Do Believe,” which appeared in 1944 and 1949, respectively.) In “Big Business,” Lilienthal argues<br/>that not only the productive and distributive superiority of the United States but also its national<br/>security depends on industrial bigness; that we now have adequate public safeguards against abuses<br/>of big business, or know well enough how to fashion them as required; that big business does not tend<br/>to destroy small business, as is often supposed, but, rather, tends to promote it; and, finally, that a big-<br/>business society does not suppress individualism, as most intellectuals believe, but actually tends to<br/>encourage it by reducing poverty, disease, and physical insecurity and increasing the opportunities for<br/>leisure and travel. Fighting words, in short, from an old New Dealer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark276"><span>Lilienthal is a man whose government career I, as a newspaper reader, had followed fairly closely.<br/>My interest in him as a government official had reached its peak in February, 1947, when, in answer<br/>to a fierce attack on him by his old enemy Senator Kenneth D. McKellar, of Tennessee, during<br/>Congressional hearings on his fitness for the A.E.C. job, he uttered a spontaneous statement of<br/>personal democratic faith that for many people still ranks as one of the most stirring attacks on what<br/>later came to be known as McCarthyism. (“One of the tenets of democracy that grow out of this<br/>central core of a belief that the individual comes first, that all men are the children of God and their<br/>personalities are therefore sacred,” Lilienthal said, among other things, “is a deep belief in civil<br/>liberties and their protection; and a repugnance to anyone who would steal from a human being that<br/>which is most precious to him, his good name, by imputing things to him, by innuendo, or by<br/>insinuation.”) The fragments of information I picked up about his new, private career left me<br/>confused. Wondering how Wall Street and business life had affected Lilienthal, and vice versa, in<br/>their belated </span></a><i>rapprochement</i><span>, I got in touch with him, and a day or so later, at his invitation, drove out<br/>to New Jersey to spend the afternoon with him.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LILIENTHAL <span class="p">and his wife, Helen Lamb Lilienthal, lived on Battle Road, in Princeton, where they had<br/>settled in 1957, after six years in New York City, at first in a house on Beekman Place and later in an<br/>apartment on Sutton Place. The Princeton house, which stands in a plot of less than an acre, is of<br/>Georgian brick with green shutters. Surrounded by other houses of its kind, the place is capacious yet<br/>anything but pretentious. Lilienthal, wearing gray slacks and a plaid sports shirt, met me at the front<br/>door. At just past sixty, he was a tall, trim man with a receding hairline, a slightly hawklike profile,<br/>and candid, piercing eyes. He led me into the living room, where he introduced Mrs. Lilienthal and<br/>then pointed out a couple of household treasures—a large Oriental rug in front of the fireplace, which<br/>he said was a gift from the Shah of Iran, and, hanging on the wall opposite the fireplace, a Chinese<br/>scroll of the late nineteenth century showing four rather roguish men, who, he told me, have a special<br/>meaning for him, since they are upper-middle-rank civil servants. Pointing to a particularly<br/>enigmatic-looking fellow, he added, with a smile, that he always thought of that one as his Oriental<br/>counterpart.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark277"><span>Mrs. Lilienthal went to get coffee, and while she was gone, I asked Lilienthal to tell me something<br/>of his post-government life, starting at the beginning. “All right,” he said. “The beginning: I left the</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A.E.C. for a number of reasons. In that kind of work, I feel, a fellow is highly expendable. If you</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>stayed too long, you might find yourself placating industry or the military, or both—building up what<br/>would amount to an atomic pork barrel. Another thing—I wanted to be allowed to speak my mind<br/>more freely than I could as a government official. I felt I’d served my term. So I turned in my<br/>resignation in November, 1949, and it went into effect three months later. As for the timing, I resigned<br/>then because, for once, I wasn’t under fire. Originally, I’d planned to do it earlier in 1949, but then<br/>came the last Congressional attack on me—the time Hickenlooper, of Iowa, accused me of<br/>‘incredible mismanagement.’” I noticed that Lilienthal did not smile in referring to the Hickenlooper<br/>affair. “I entered private life with both trepidation and relief,” he went on. “The trepidation was<br/>about my ability to make a living, and it was very real. Oh, I’d been a practicing lawyer as a young<br/>man, in Chicago, before going into government work, and made quite a lot of money at it, too. But<br/>now I didn’t </span><i>want </i><span>to practice law. And I was worried about what else I could do. I was so obsessed<br/>with the subject that I harped on it all the time, and my wife and my friends began to kid me. That<br/>Christmas of 1949, my wife gave me a beggar’s tin cup, and one of my friends gave me a guitar to go<br/>with it. The feeling of relief—well, that was a matter of personal privacy and freedom. As a private<br/>citizen, I wouldn’t have to be trailed around by hordes of security officers as I had been at the A.E.C.<br/>I wouldn’t have to answer the charges of Congressional committees. And, above all, I’d be able to<br/>talk freely to my wife again.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark278"><span>Mrs. Lilienthal had returned with the coffee as her husband was talking, and now she sat down with<br/>us. She comes, I knew, from a family of pioneers who, over several generations, moved westward<br/>from New England to Ohio to Indiana to Oklahoma, where she was born. She seemed to me to look<br/>the part—that of a woman of dignity, patience, practicality, and gentle strength. “I can tell you that my<br/>husband’s resignation was a relief to </span></a><i>me</i><span>,” she said. “Before he went with the A.E.C., we’d always<br/>talked over all aspects of his work. When he took that job, we agreed between us that although we’d<br/>indulge in the discussion of personalities as freely as we pleased, he would never tell me anything<br/>about the work of the A.E.C. that I couldn’t read in the newspapers. It was a terrible constraint to be<br/>under.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Lilienthal nodded. “I’d come home at night with some frightful experience in me,” he said. “No one<br/>who so much as touches the atom is ever quite the same again. Perhaps I’d have been in a series of<br/>conferences and listened to the kind of talk that many military and scientific men go in for—cities full<br/>of  human beings referred to as ‘targets,’ and that sort of thing. I never got used to that impersonal<br/>jargon. I’d come home sick at heart. But I couldn’t talk about it to Helen. I wasn’t allowed to get it off<br/>my chest.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“And now there wouldn’t be any more hearings,” Mrs. Lilienthal said. “Those terrible hearings!<br/>I’ll never forget one Washington cocktail party we went to, for our sins. My husband had been going<br/>through one of the endless series of Congressional hearings. A woman in a funny hat came gushing up<br/>to him and said something like ‘Oh, Mr. Lilienthal, I was </span><i>so </i><span>anxious to come to your hearings, but I<br/>just couldn’t make it. I’m so sorry. I just </span><i>love </i>hearings, don’t you?’”</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Husband and wife looked at each other, and this time Lilienthal managed a grin.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LILIENTHAL <span class="p">seemed glad to get on to what happened next. At about the time his resignation became<br/>effective, he told me, he was approached by various men from Harvard representing the fields of<br/>history, public administration, and law, who asked him to accept an appointment to the faculty. But he<br/>decided he didn’t want to become a professor any more than he wanted to practice law. Within the<br/>next few weeks came offers from numerous law firms in New York and Washington, and from some<br/>industrial companies. Reassured by these that he was not going to need the tin cup and guitar after all,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark279"><span>Lilienthal, after mulling over the offers, finally turned them all down and settled, in May, 1950, for a<br/>part-time job as a consultant to the celebrated banking firm of Lazard Frères &amp; Co., whose senior<br/>partner, André Meyer, he had met through Albert Lasker, a mutual friend. Lazard gave him an office<br/>in its headquarters at 44 Wall, but before he could do much consulting, he was off on a lecture tour<br/>across the United States, followed by a trip to Europe that summer, with his wife, on behalf of the late<br/></span></a><i>Collier’s </i><span>magazine. The trip did not result in any articles, though, and on returning home in the fall he<br/>found it necessary to get back on a full-time income-producing basis; this he did by becoming a<br/>consultant to various other companies, among them the Carrier Corporation and the Radio<br/>Corporation of America. To Carrier he offered advice on managerial problems. For R.C.A., he<br/>worked on the question of color television, ultimately advising his client to concentrate on technical<br/>research rather than on law-court squabbles over patents; he also helped persuade the company to<br/>press its computer program and to stay out of the construction of atomic reactors. Early in 1951, he<br/>took another trip abroad for </span><i>Collier’s</i><span>—to India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Japan. This trip produced an<br/>article—published in </span><i>Collier’s </i><span>that August—in which he proposed a solution to the dispute between<br/>India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the headwaters of the Indus River. Lilienthal’s idea was that the<br/>tension between the two countries could best be lessened by a coöperative program to improve living<br/>conditions in the whole disputed area through economic development of the Indus Basin. Nine years<br/>later, largely through the financial backing and moral support of Eugene R. Black and the World<br/>Bank, the Lilienthal plan was essentially adopted, and an Indus treaty signed between India and<br/>Pakistan. But the immediate reaction to his article was general indifference, and Lilienthal,<br/>temporarily stymied and considerably disillusioned, once more settled down to the humbler problems<br/>of private business.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark280"><span>At this point in Lilienthal’s narrative, the doorbell rang. Mrs. Lilienthal went to answer it, and I<br/>could hear her talking to someone—a gardener, evidently—about the pruning of some roses. After<br/>listening restlessly for a minute or two, Lilienthal called to his wife, “Helen, please tell Domenic to<br/>prune those roses farther back than he did last year!” Mrs. Lilienthal went outside with Domenic, and<br/>Lilienthal remarked, “Domenic always prunes too gently, to my way of thinking. It’s a case of our<br/>backgrounds—Italy versus the Middle West.” Then, resuming where he had left off, he said that his<br/>association with Lazard Frères, and more particularly with Meyer, had led him into an association,<br/>first as a consultant and later as an executive, with a small company called the Minerals Separation<br/>North American Corporation, in which Lazard Frères had a large interest. It was in this undertaking<br/>that, unexpectedly, he made his fortune. The company was in trouble, and Meyer’s notion was that<br/>Lilienthal might be the man to do something about it. Subsequently, in the course of a series of<br/>mergers, acquisitions, and other maneuvers, the company’s name was changed to, successively, the<br/>Attapulgus Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation, the Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corporation of America,<br/>and, in 1960, the Minerals &amp; Chemicals Philipp Corporation; meanwhile, its annual receipts rose<br/>from about seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, for 1952, to something over two hundred and<br/>seventy-four million, for 1960. For Lilienthal, the acceptance of Meyer’s commission to look into the<br/>company’s affairs was the beginning of a four-year immersion in the day-to-day problems of<br/>managing a business; the experience, he said decisively, turned out to be one of his life’s richest, and<br/>by no means only in the literal sense of that word.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I HAVE <span class="p">reconstructed the corporate facts behind Lilienthal’s experience partly from what he told me in<br/>Princeton, partly from a subsequent study of some of the company’s published documents, and partly<br/>from talks with other persons interested in the firm. Minerals Separation North American, which was</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark281"><span>founded in 1916 as an offshoot of a British firm, was a patent company, deriving its chief income<br/>from royalties on patents for processes used in refining copper ore and the ores of other nonferrous<br/>minerals. Its activities were twofold—attempting to develop new patents in its research laboratory,<br/>and offering technical services to the mining and manufacturing companies that leased its old ones. By<br/>1950, although it was still netting a nice annual profit, it was in a bad way. Under the direction of its<br/>long-time president, Dr. Seth Gregory—who was then over ninety but still ruled the company with an<br/>iron hand, commuting daily between his midtown apartment hotel and his office, at 11 Broadway, in a<br/>regally purple Rolls-Royce—it had cut down its research activities to almost nothing and was living<br/>on half a dozen old patents, all of which were scheduled to go into the public domain in from five to<br/>eight years. In effect, it was a still healthy company living under a death sentence. Lazard Frères, as a<br/>large stockholder, was understandably concerned. Dr. Gregory was persuaded to retire on a<br/>handsome pension, and in February, 1952, after working with Minerals Separation for some time as a<br/>consultant, Lilienthal was installed as the company’s president and a member of its board of<br/>directors. His first task was to find a new source of income to replace the fast-expiring patents, and<br/>he and the other directors agreed that the way to accomplish this was through a merger; it fell to<br/>Lilienthal to participate in arranging one between Minerals Separation and another company in which<br/>Lazard Frères—along with the Wall Street firm of F. Eberstadt &amp; Co.—had large holdings: the<br/>Attapulgus Clay Company, of Attapulgus, Georgia, which produced a very rare kind of clay that is<br/>useful in purifying petroleum products, and which manufactured various household products, among<br/>them a floor cleaner called Speedi-Dri.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark282"><span>As a marriage broker between Minerals Separation and Attapulgus, Lilienthal had the touchy job of<br/>persuading the executives of the Southern company that they were not being used as pawns by a bunch<br/>of rapacious Wall Street bankers. Being an agent of the bankers was an unaccustomed role for<br/>Lilienthal, but he evidently carried it off with aplomb, despite the fact that his presence complicated<br/>the emotional problems still further by introducing into the situation a whiff of galloping Socialism.<br/>“Dave was very effective in building up the Attapulgus people’s morale and confidence,” another<br/>Wall Streeter has told me. “He reconciled them to the merger, and showed them its advantages for<br/>them.” Lilienthal himself told me, “I felt at home in the administrative and technical parts of the job,<br/>but the financial part had to be done by the people from Lazard and Eberstadt. Every time they began<br/>talking about spinoffs and exchanges of shares, I was lost. I didn’t even know what a spinoff </span></a><i>was</i><span>.”<br/>(As Lilienthal knows now, it is, not to get too technical about it, a division of a company into two or<br/>more companies—the opposite of a merger.) The merger took place in December, 1952, and neither<br/>the Attapulgus people nor the Minerals Separation people had any reason to regret it, because both<br/>the profits and the stock price of the newly formed company—the Attapulgus Minerals &amp; Chemicals<br/>Corporation—soon began to rise. At the time of the merger, Lilienthal was made chairman of the<br/>board of directors, at an annual salary of eighteen thousand dollars. Over the next three years, while<br/>serving first in this position and later as chairman of the executive committee, he had a large part not<br/>only in the conduct of the company’s routine affairs but also in its further growth through a series of<br/>new mergers—one in 1954, with Edgar Brothers, a leading producer of kaolin for paper coating, and<br/>two in 1955, with a pair of limestone concerns in Ohio and Virginia. The mergers and the increased<br/>efficiency that went with them were not long in paying off; between 1952 and 1955 the company’s net<br/>profit per share more than quintupled.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The mechanics of Lilienthal’s own rise from the comparative rags of a public servant to the riches<br/>of a successful entrepreneur are baldly outlined in the company’s proxy statements for its annual and<br/>special stockholders’ meetings. (There are few public documents more indiscreet than proxy</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark301" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 15pt;" name="bookmark283">statements, in which the precise private stockholdings of directors must be listed.) In November,<br/>1952, Minerals Separation North American granted Lilienthal, as a supplement to his annual salary, a<br/>stock option.</a><a href="#bookmark301" class="a">*</a> <span style=" color: #000;">His option entitled him to buy as many as fifty thousand shares of the firm’s stock from<br/>its treasury at $4.87½ per share, then the going rate, any time before the end of 1955, and in exchange<br/>he signed a contract agreeing to serve the company as an active executive throughout 1953, 1954, and<br/>1955. The potential financial advantage to him, of course, as to all other recipients of stock options,<br/>lay in the fact that if the price of the stock rose substantially, he could buy shares at the option price<br/>and thus have a holding that would immediately be worth much more than he paid for it. Furthermore,<br/>and more important, if he should later decide to sell his shares, the proceeds would be a capital gain,<br/>taxable at a maximum rate of 25%. Of course, if the stock failed to go up, the option would be<br/>worthless. But, like so many stocks of the mid-fifties, Lilienthal’s did go up, fantastically. By the end<br/>of 1954, according to the proxy statements, Lilienthal had exercised his option to the extent of buying<br/>twelve thousand seven hundred and fifty shares, which were then worth not $4.87½ each but about</span><a name="bookmark284">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$20. In February, 1955, he sold off four thousand shares at $22.75 each, bringing in ninety-one<br/>thousanddollars. This sum, less capital-gains tax, was then applied against further purchases under<br/>the option, and in August, 1955, the proxy statements show, Lilienthal raised his holdings to almost<br/>forty thousand shares, or close to the number he held at the time of my visit to him. By that time, the<br/>stock, which had at first been sold over the counter, not only had achieved a listing on the New York<br/>Stock Exchange but had become one of the Exchange’s highflying speculative favorites; its price had<br/>skyrocketed to about forty dollars a share, and Lilienthal, obviously, was solidly in the millionaire<br/>class. Moreover, the company was now on a sound long-term basis, paying an annual cash dividend<br/>of fifty cents a share, and the Lilienthal family’s financial worries were permanently over.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Fiscally speaking, Lilienthal told me, his symbolic moment of triumph was the day, in June of<br/>1955, when the shares of Minerals &amp; Chemicals graduated to a listing on the New York Stock<br/>Exchange. In accordance with custom, Lilienthal, as a top officer, was invited onto the floor to shake<br/>hands with the president of the Exchange and be shown around generally. “I went through it in a<br/>daze,” Lilienthal told me. “Until then, I’d never been inside any stock exchange in my life. It was all<br/>mysterious and fascinating. No zoo could have seemed more strange to me.” How the Stock Exchange<br/>felt at this stage about having the former wearer of horns on its floor is not recorded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark285">IN </a><span class="p">telling me about his experience with the company, Lilienthal had spoken with zest and had made<br/>the whole thing sound mysterious and fascinating. I asked him what, apart from the obvious financial<br/>inducement, had led him to devote himself to the affairs of a small firm, and how it had felt for the<br/>former boss of T.V.A. and A.E.C. to be, in effect, peddling Attapulgite, kaolin, limestone, and<br/>Speedi-Dri. Lilienthal leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. “I wanted an entrepreneurial<br/>experience,” he said. “I found a great appeal in the idea of taking a small and quite crippled company<br/>and trying to make something of it. Building. That kind of building, I thought, is the central thing in<br/>American free enterprise, and something I’d missed in all my government work. I wanted to try my<br/>hand at it. Now, about how it felt. Well, it felt plenty exciting. It was full of intellectual stimulation,<br/>and a lot of my old ideas changed. I conceived a great new respect for financiers—men like André<br/>Meyer. There’s a correctness about them, a certain high sense of honor, that I’d never had any<br/>conception of. I found that business life is full of creative, original minds—along with the usual<br/>number of second-guessers, of course. Furthermore, I found it seductive. In fact, I was in danger of<br/>becoming a slave. Business has its man-eating side, and part of the man-eating side is that it’s so<br/>absorbing. I found that the things you read—for instance, that acquiring money for its own sake can</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark302" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 15pt;" name="bookmark286">become an addiction if you’re not careful—are literally true. Certain good friends helped keep me on<br/>the track—men like Ferdinand Eberstadt, who became my fellow-director after the Attapulgus<br/>merger, and Nathan Greene, special counsel to Lazard Frères, who was on the board for a while.<br/>Greene was a kind of business father confessor to me. I remember his saying, ‘You think you’ll make<br/>your pile and then be independent. My friend, in Wall Street you don’t just win your independence at<br/>one stroke. To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, you have to win your independence over again every<br/>day.’ I found that he was right about that. Oh, I had my problems. I questioned myself at every step. It<br/>was exhausting. You see, for so long I’d been associated with two pretty far-reaching things—<br/>institutions. I had a feeling of identity with them; in that kind of work you are able to lose your sense<br/>of self. Now, with myself to worry about—my personal standards as well as my financial future—I<br/>found myself wondering all the time whether I was making the right move. But that part’s all in my<br/>journal, and you can read it there, if you like.” </a><a href="#bookmark302">*</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I said I certainly would like to read it, and Lilienthal led me to his study, in the basement. It proved<br/>to be a good-sized room whose windows opened on window wells into which strands of ivy were<br/>trailing; light came in from outside, and even a little slanting sunshine, but the tops of the window<br/>wells were too high to permit a view of the garden or the neighborhood. Lilienthal remarked, “My<br/>neighbor Robert Oppenheimer complained about the enclosed feeling when he first saw this room. I<br/>told him that was just the feeling I wanted!” Then he showed me a filing cabinet, standing in a corner;<br/>it contained the journal, in rows and rows of loose-leaf notebooks, the earliest of them dating back to<br/>its author’s high-school days. Having invited me to make myself at home, Lilienthal left me alone in<br/>his study and went back upstairs.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>Taking him at his word, I went for a turn or two around the room, looking at the pictures on the<br/>walls and finding about what might have been expected: inscribed photographs from Franklin D.<br/>Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Senator George Norris, Louis Brandeis; pictures of Lilienthal with<br/>Roosevelt, with Willkie, with Fiorello LaGuardia, with Nelson Rockefeller, with Nehru in India; a<br/>night view of the Fontana Dam, in the Tennessee Valley, being built under a blaze of electricity<br/>supplied by T.V.A. power plants. A man’s study reflects himself as he wishes to be seen publicly, but<br/>his journal, if he is honest, reflects something else. I had not browsed long in Lilienthal’s journal<br/>before I realized that it was an extraordinary document—not merely a historical source of unusual<br/>interest but a searching record of a public man’s thoughts and emotions. I leafed through the years of<br/>his association with Minerals &amp; Chemicals, and, scattered amid much about family, Democratic<br/>politics, friends, trips abroad, reflections on national policies, and hopes and fears for the republic, I<br/>came upon the following entries having to do with business and life in New York:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">May 24, 1951: <span class="s6">Looks as if I am in the minerals business.

[Last] Thursday was a day<br/>in which I shared some of Willkie’s feeling.… There was a grandeur about the place, and adventure, a sense of being in the center of a<br/>great achievement, New York City in the fifties.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">October 28, 1951: <span class="s6">What I am reaching for, perhaps, is to have my cake and eat it, too, but in a way this is not wholly senseless nor</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>futile. That is, I can have enough actual contact with the affairs of business to keep a sense of reality, or develop one. How otherwise<br/>can I explain the pleasure I get in visiting a copper mine or talking to operators of an electric furnace, or a coal-research project, or<br/>watching how André Meyer works.… But along with that I want to be free enough to think about what these things mean, free enough<br/>to read outside the immediate field of interest.

What I wanted was to be<br/>an observer of this fascinating activity that so colors and affects the world’s life, not … an observer from without (as a writer, teacher)<br/>but from the arena itself. I still have this feeling, and when I get low and glad to chuck the whole thing (as I have from time to time), the<br/>sustaining part is that even the bumps and sore spots are experiences, actual experiences within the business world.…</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>Then, too, [I wanted to be able to make] a comparison of the managers of business, the spirit, the tensions, the motivations, etc., with<br/>those of government (something I keep doing anyway)—and that needs doing to understand either government or business.

The beginning of better costs. The catalyst idea.

In the<br/>government, Dave was used to a sense of great authority and power—tremendous national and<br/>international responsibility. People wanted to be seen with him. Foreign dignitaries sought him out.<br/>He had all sorts of facilities—rows of buttons on his desk. He pushed them, and lawyers, technicians,<br/>accountants appeared to do his bidding. All right, now he comes to Wall Street. There’s a big</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>welcoming reception, he meets all the partners of his new firm and their wives, he’s given a nice<br/>office with a carpet. But there’s nothing on his desk—only one button, and all it summons is a<br/>secretary. He doesn’t have perquisites like limousines. Furthermore, he really has no responsibility.<br/>He says to himself, ‘I’m an idea man, I’ve got to have some ideas.’ He has some, but they’re not given<br/>much attention by the partners. So the outward form of his new work is a letdown. The same with its<br/>content. In Washington, it had been development of natural resources, atomic energy, or the like—<br/>world-shaking things. Now it turns out to be some little business to make money. It all seems a bit<br/>petty.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark289"><span>“Then, there’s the matter of money itself. In the government, our hypothetical man didn’t need it so<br/>badly. He had all these services and the basic comforts supplied him at no personal cost, and besides<br/>he had a great sense of moral superiority. He was able to sneer at people who were out making<br/>money. He could think of somebody in his law-school class who was making a pile in the Street, and<br/>say, ‘He’s sold out.’ Then our man leaves government and goes to the Wall Street fleshpots himself,<br/>and he says, ‘Boy, am I going to make these guys pay for my services!’ They do pay, too. He gets big<br/>fees for consulting. Then he finds out about big income taxes, how he has to pay most of his income to<br/>the government now instead of getting his livelihood from it. The shoe is on the other foot. He may—<br/>sometimes he does—begin to scream ‘Confiscation!,’ just like any old Wall Streeter.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“How did Dave handle these problems? Well, he had his troubles—after all, he was starting a<br/>second sort of life—but he handled them just about as well as they can be handled. He was never<br/>bored, and he never screamed ‘Confiscation!’ He has a great capacity for sinking himself in<br/>something. The subject matter isn’t so important to him. It’s almost as if he were able to think that<br/>what he’s doing is important, whether it is or not, simply </span><i>because </i><span>he’s doing it. His ability was<br/>invaluable to Minerals &amp; Chemicals, and not just as an administrator. Dave is a lawyer, after all; he<br/>knows more about corporate finances than he likes to admit. He enjoys playing the barefoot boy, but<br/>he’s hardly that. Dave is an almost perfect example of somebody who kept his independence while<br/>getting rich on Wall Street.”)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark290"><span>One way and another, then—reading through these ambivalent protestations in the journal, and later<br/>hearing Greene—I seemed to detect under the exuberance and the absorption a nagging sense of<br/>dissatisfaction, almost of compromise. For Lilienthal, the obviously genuine thrill of having a new<br/>kind            of experience, and an almost unimaginably profitable one, had been, I sensed, a rose with a<br/>worm in it. I went back up to the living room. There I found Lilienthal fiat on his back on the Shah’s<br/>rug underneath a pile of pre-school-age children. At least, it looked at first glance like a pile; on<br/>closer inspection I found that it consisted of just two boys. Mrs. Lilienthal, who had returned from the<br/>garden, introduced them as Allen and Daniel Bromberger, sons of the Lilienthals’ daughter, Nancy,<br/>and Sylvain Bromberger, adding that the Brombergers were living nearby, since Sylvain was teaching<br/>philosophy at the university. (A few weeks later, Bromberger moved on to the University of<br/>Chicago.) The Lilienthals’ only other offspring, David, Jr., lived in Edgartown, Massachusetts, where<br/>he     had settled down to become a writer, as he subsequently did. In response to the urging of the senior<br/>Lilienthals, the grandchildren climbed off their grandfather and disappeared from the room. When<br/>things were normal again, I told Lilienthal my reaction to the entries I had read in the journal, and he<br/>hesitated for a while before speaking. “Yes,” he said, finally. “Well, one thing—it wasn’t making all<br/>that money that worried me. That didn’t make me feel either good or bad, by itself. In the government<br/>years, we’d always paid our bills, and by scrimping we’d been able to save enough to send the kids<br/>to college. We’d never thought much about money. And then making a lot of it, making a million—I<br/>was surprised, of course. I’d never especially aimed at that or thought it might happen to me. It’s like</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>when you’re a boy and you try to jump six feet. Then you find you can jump six feet, and you say,<br/>‘Well, so what?’ It’s sort of irrelevant. Over the past few years, a lot of people have said to me,<br/>‘How does it feel to be rich?’ At first, I was kind of offended—there seemed to be an implied<br/>criticism in the question—but I’m over that. I tell them it doesn’t feel any special way. The way I feel<br/>is—But this is going to sound stuffy.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“No, I don’t think it’s stuffy,” said Mrs. Lilienthal, anticipating what was coming.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“Yes, it is, but I’m going to say it anyway,” said Lilienthal. “I don’t think money makes much<br/>difference, as long as you have enough.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I don’t quite agree,” said Mrs. Lilienthal. “It doesn’t make much difference when you’re young.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You don’t mind then, as long as you can struggle along. But as you get older, it <i>is </i>helpful.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark291"><span>Lilienthal nodded in deference to that. Then he said that he thought the undertone of dissatisfaction I<br/>had noticed in the journal probably stemmed, at least in part, from the fact that his career in private<br/>business, absorbing though it was, did not bring with it the gratifications of public-service work.<br/>True, he had not been deprived of them entirely, because it was at the height of his Minerals &amp;<br/>Chemicals  operations, in 1954, that he first went to Colombia, at the request of that country’s<br/>government, and, serving as a peso-a-year consultant, started the Cauca Valley project that was later<br/>continued by the Development &amp; Resources Corporation. But for the most part being a top officer of<br/>Minerals &amp; Chemicals had kept him pretty well tied down, and he’d had to regard the Colombia work<br/>as a sideline, if not merely a hobby. I found it impossible to avoid seeing symbolic significance in the<br/>fact that the principal material with which Lilienthal the businessman had been engaged was—clay.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I thought of something else in Lilienthal’s life at that time that might have taken some of the kick out<br/>of the process of becoming a successful businessman. His “Big Business” book had come out when he<br/>wasin the thick of the Minerals &amp; Chemicals work. I wondered whether, since it is such an uncritical<br/>paean to free enterprise, it had been construed by some people as a rationalization of his new career,<br/>and I asked about this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“Well, the ideas in the book were rather a shock to some of my husband’s New Deal friends, all<br/>right,” Mrs. Lilienthal said, a bit dryly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark292"><span>“They needed shocking, damn it!” Lilienthal burst out. He spoke with some heat, and I thought of<br/>the phrase in his journal—used there in an entirely different context but still in reference to himself—<br/>about defensiveness shown by belligerence. After a moment, he went on, in a normal tone, “My wife<br/>and daughter thought I didn’t spend enough time working on the book, and they were right. I wrote it<br/>in too much of a hurry. My conclusions aren’t supported by enough argument. For one thing, I should<br/>have spelled out in more detail my opposition to the way the antitrust laws are administered. But the<br/>anti-trust part wasn’t the real trouble. The thing that really shook up some of my old friends was what<br/>I said about big industry in relation to individualism, and about the machine in relation to aesthetics.<br/>Morris Cooke, who used to be administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration—he was one<br/>who was shaken up. He took me apart over the book, and I took him apart back. The anti-bigness<br/>dogmatists stopped having anything to do with me. They simply wrote me off. I wasn’t hurt or<br/>disappointed. Those people are living on nostalgia; they look backward, and I try to look forward.<br/>Then, of course, there were the trust busters. They </span></a><i>really </i><span>went after me. But isn’t trust busting, in the<br/>sense of breaking up big companies simply because they’re big, pretty much a relic of a past era?<br/>Yes, I still think I was right in the main things I said—perhaps ahead of my time, but right.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“The trouble was the timing,” Mrs. Lilienthal said. “The book came so close to coinciding with my<br/>husband’s leaving public service and going into private business. Some people thought it represented<br/>a change in point of view induced by expediency. Which it didn’t!”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>“No,” Lilienthal said. “The book was written mostly in 1952, but all the ideas in it were hatched<br/>while I was still in public service. For example, my idea that bigness is essential for national security<br/>came in large part out of my experiences in the A.E.C. The company that had the research and<br/>manufacturing facilities to make the atomic  bomb an operational weapon, so engineered that it<br/>wouldn’t require Ph.D.s to use it in the field—Bell Telephone, to be specific—was a big company.<br/>Because it was so big, the Anti-Trust Division of the Department of Justice was seeking to break the<br/>Bell System into several parts—unsuccessfully, as it turned out—at the very time we in the A.E.C.<br/>were calling on it to do a vital defense job that required unity. That seemed wrong. More generally,<br/>the whole point of view I expressed in the book goes way back to my quarrel with Arthur Morgan, the<br/>first T.V.A. chairman, in the early thirties. He had great faith in a handicraft economy, I was for large-<br/>scale industry. T.V.A., after all, was, and is, the biggest power system in the free world. In T.V.A. I<br/>always believed in bigness—along with decentralization. But, you know, the chapter I hoped would<br/>produce the most discussion was the one on bigness as a promoter of individualism. It </span><i>did </i><span>produce<br/>discussion, of a sort. I remember people—academic people, mostly—coming up to me with<br/>incredulous expressions and saying something that started with ‘Do you </span><i>really </i><span>believe …’ Well, my<br/>answer would start with ‘Yes, I really do believe …’”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark293"><span>One other touchy matter that Lilienthal may have questioned himself about in the process of making<br/>his Wall Street fortune was the fact that in making it he had not really </span></a><i>needed </i><span>to scream<br/>“Confiscation,”since he had made it through a tax loophole, the stock option. Possibly there have<br/>been liberal, reformist businessmen who have refused to accept stock options on principle, although I<br/>have never heard of one doing so, and I am not convinced that such a renunciation would be a<br/>sensible or useful form of protest. In any event, I didn’t ask Lilienthal about the matter; in the absence<br/>of any accepted code of journalism every journalist writes his own, and in mine, such a question<br/>would have come close to invasion of moral privacy. In retrospect, though, I almost wish I had<br/>violated my code that one time. Lilienthal, being Lilienthal, might have objected to the question<br/>strenuously, but I think he would have answered it equally strenuously, and without hedging. As things<br/>were, after discoursing on the critical reactions to his book, “Big Business,” he got up and walked to<br/>a window. “I see Domenic has been pretty cautious about his rose-pruning,” he said to his wife.<br/>“Maybe I’ll go out later and cut them back some more.” His jaw was set in a way that made me feel<br/>pretty sure I knew how the rose-pruning controversy was going to be resolved.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark294">THE </a><span class="p">triumphant solution to Lilienthal’s problem—the way that he eventually found to have his cake<br/>and eat it—was the Development &amp; Resources Corporation. The corporation arose out of a series of<br/>conversations between Lilienthal and Meyer  during the spring of 1955, in the course of which<br/>Lilienthal pointed out that he was well acquainted with dozens of foreign dignitaries and technical<br/>personnel who had come to visit the T.V.A., and said that their intense interest in that project seemed<br/>to indicate that at least some of their countries would be receptive to the idea of starting similar<br/>programs. “Our aim in forming D. &amp; R. was not to try to remold the world, or any large part of it, but<br/>only to try to help accomplish some rather specific things, and, incidentally, make a profit,” Lilienthal<br/>told me. “André was not so sure about the profit—we both knew there would be a deficit at first—but<br/>he liked the idea of doing constructive things, and Lazard Frères decided to back us, in return for a<br/>half interest in the corporation.” Clapp, who was serving at the time as deputy New York City<br/>administrator, came in as co-founder of the venture, and the subsequent executive appointments made</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>D. &amp; R. virtually a T.V.A. alumni association: John Oliver, who became executive vice-president,<br/>had been with T.V.A. from 1942 to 1954, ending up as its general manager; W. L. Voorduin, who</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>became director of engineering, had been with T.V.A. for a decade and had planned its whole system<br/>of dams; Walton Seymour, who became vice-president for industrial development, had been a T.V.A.<br/>consultant on electric-power marketing for thirteen years; and a dozen other former T.V.A. men were<br/>scattered on down through the ranks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In July, 1955, D. &amp; R. set up shop at 44 Wall, and set to work finding clients. What was to prove<br/>its most important one came to light during a World Bank meeting in Istanbul that Lilienthal and his<br/>wife attended in September of that year. At the meeting, Lilienthal fell in with Abolhassan Ebtehaj,<br/>then head of a seven-year development plan in Iran; as it happened, Iran was just about the ideal D. &amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>R. client, since, for one thing, the royalties on its nationalized oil industry gave it considerable capital<br/>with which to pay for the development of its resources, and, for another, what it desperately needed<br/>was technical and professional guidance. The encounter with Ebtehaj led to an invitation to Lilienthal<br/>and Clapp to visit Iran as the guests of the Shah, and see what they thought could be done about<br/>Khuzistan. Lilienthal’s employment contract with Minerals &amp; Chemicals ended that December;<br/>although he stayed on as a director, he was now free to devote all his time, or nearly all of it, to D. &amp;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark295"><span>R. In February, 1956, he and Clapp went to Iran. “Before then, I blush to say, I had never heard of<br/>Khuzistan,” Lilienthal told me. “I’ve learned a lot about it since then. It was the heart of the Old<br/>Testament Elamite kingdom and later of the Persian Empire. The ruins of Persepolis are not far away,<br/>and those of Susa, where King Darius had his winter palace, are in the very center of Khuzistan. In<br/>ancient times, the whole region had an extensive water-conservation system—you can still find the<br/>remains of canals that were probably built by Darius twenty-five hundred years ago—but after the<br/>decline of the Persian Empire the water system was ruined by invasion and neglect. Lord Curzon<br/>described what the Khuzistan uplands looked like a century ago—‘a desert over which the eye may<br/>roam unarrested for miles.’ It was that way when we got there. Nowadays, Khuzistan is one of the<br/>world’s richest oil fields—the famous Abadan refinery is at its southern tip—but the inhabitants, two<br/>and a half million of them, haven’t benefited from that. The rivers have flowed unused, the fabulously<br/>rich soil has lain fallow, and all but a tiny fraction of the people have continued to live in desperate<br/>poverty. When Clapp and I first saw the place, we were appalled. Still, for two old T.V.A. hands like<br/>us, it was a dream; it was simply crying out for development. We looked for sites for dams, likely<br/>spots to hunt for minerals and make soil-fertility studies, and so on. We saw flares of natural gas<br/>rising from oil fields. That was waste, and it suggested petrochemical plants, to use the gas for<br/>making fertilizer and plastics. In eight days we’d roughed out a plan, and in about two weeks D. &amp; R.<br/>had signed a five-year contract with the Iranian government.</span></a><a name="bookmark296">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“That was only the beginning. Bill Voorduin, our chief engineer, flew out there and spotted a<br/>wonderful dam site at a place just a few miles from the ruins of Susa—a narrow canyon with walls<br/>that rise almost vertically from the bed of the Dez River. We found we were going to have to manage<br/>the project as well as advise on it, and so our next job was lining up our managerial group. To give<br/>you some idea of the size of the project, right now there are about seven hundred people working on it<br/>at the professional level—a hundred Americans, three hundred Iranians, and three hundred others,<br/>mostly Europeans, who work directly for firms under subcontracts. Besides that, there are about<br/>forty-seven hundred Iranian laborers. Over five thousand people, all told. The entire plan includes<br/>fourteen dams, on five different rivers, and will take many years to finish. D. &amp; R. has just completed<br/>its first contract, for five years, and signed a new one, for a year and a half, with option to renew for<br/>another five years. Quite a bit has been accomplished already. Take the first dam—the Dez one. It’s<br/>to be six hundred and twenty feet high, or more than half again as high as the Aswan, in Egypt, and it<br/>will eventually irrigate three hundred and sixty thousand acres and generate five hundred and twenty</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark297"><span>thousand kilowatts of electricity. It should be finished early in 1963. Meanwhile, a sugar plantation—<br/>the first in Khuzistan in twenty-five centuries—has been started, with irrigation by pumped water; it<br/>should yield its first crop this summer, and a sugar refinery will be ready by the time the sugar is.<br/>Another thing: eventually the region will supply its own electric power from the dams, but for the<br/>interim period a high-tension line, the first anywhere in Iran, has been put in over the seventy-two<br/>miles from Abadan to Ahwaz—a city of a hundred and twenty thousand that previously had no power<br/>source except half a dozen little diesels, which seldom worked.”</span></a><a name="bookmark298">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>While the Iranian project was proceeding, D. &amp; R. was also busy lining up and carrying out its<br/>programs for Italy, Colombia, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, and Puerto Rico, as well as programs for<br/>private business groups in Chile and the Philippines. A job that D. &amp; R. had just taken on for the<br/>United States Army Corps of Engineers excited Lilienthal enormously—an investigation of the<br/>economic impact of power from a proposed dam on the Alaskan sector of the Yukon, which he<br/>described as “the river with the greatest hydroelectric potential remaining on this continent.”<br/>Meanwhile, Lazard Frères retained its financial interest in the firm and now very happily collected its<br/>share of a substantial annual profit, and Lilienthal happily took to teasing Meyer about his former<br/>skepticism as to D. &amp; R. financial prospects.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Lilienthal’s new career had meant a highly peripatetic life both for him and for Mrs. Lilienthal. He<br/>showed me his foreign-travel log for 1960, which he said was a fairly typical year, and it read as<br/>follows:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">January 23-March 26: <span class="s6">Honolulu, Tokyo, Manila; Iligan, Mindanao;</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manila, Bangkok, Siemreap, Bangkok; Tehran, Ahwaz, Andimeshk, Ahwaz, Tehran; Geneva, Brussels, Madrid; home.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">October 11–17: <span class="s6">Buenos Aires; Patagonia; home.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">November 18–December 5: <span class="s6">London, Tehran, Rome, Milan, Paris, home.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Then he went and got the volume of his journal that relates to those trips. Turning to the pages on<br/>his stay in Iran early last spring, I was particularly struck by a few excerpts:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Ahwaz, March 5: <span class="s6">The cry of the Arab women as the Shah’s big black Chrysler passed them, a solid row along the road from the<br/>airport, made me think of the rebel yell; then I recognized it: it was the Indian yelp, the kind we used to make as kids, moving our hand<br/>over our mouths to give that undulating wail.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Ahwaz, March 11: <span class="s6">Our experience in the villagers’ huts on Wednesday threw me into a deep pit. I hovered between despair—which is<br/>an emotion I consider a sin—and anger, which doesn’t do much good, I suppose.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Andimeshk, March 9: <span class="s6">… We have travelled many miles, through dust, mudholes where we got stuck fast, and some of the roughest<br/>“roads” I have ever known—and we also travelled back to the ninth century, and earlier, visiting villages and going into mud “homes”<br/>quite unbelievable—and unforgettable forever and ever. As the Biblical oath has it: Let my right hand wither if I ever forget how some of<br/>the most attractive of my fellow human beings live—are living tonight, only a few kilometres from here, where we visited them this<br/>afternoon.…</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 29pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;"><span>And yet I am as sure as I am writing these notes that the Ghebli area, of only 45,000 acres, swallowed in the vastness of the<br/>Khuzistan, will become as well known as, say, the community of Tupelo … became, or New Harmony or Salt Lake City when it was<br/>founded by a handful of dedicated men in a pass of the great Rockies.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The afternoon shadows were getting long on Battle Road, and it was time for me to be going.<br/>Lilienthal walked out to my car with me, and on the way I asked him whether he ever missed the<br/>rough-and-tumble, and the limelight, of being perhaps the most controversial man in Washington. He<br/>grinned, and said, “Sure.” When we reached the car, he went on, “I never intended to be especially<br/>combative, in Washington or in the Tennessee Valley. It was just that people kept disagreeing with<br/>me. But, all right, I wouldn’t have put myself in controversial situations so much if I hadn’t wanted to.<br/>I guess I </span><i>was </i>combative. When I was a kid, I was interested in boxing. At high school—in Michigan</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark299"><span>City, Indiana—I boxed a lot with a cousin of mine, and while I was in college, at DePauw, in central<br/>Indiana, I took to boxing during the summers with a man who had been a professional light-<br/>heavyweight. The Tacoma Tiger, he’d been called. Working out with him was a challenge. If I made a<br/>mistake, I’d be on the floor. I wanted just once to land on him </span></a><i>good</i><span>. It was my ambition. I never did,<br/>of course, but I got to be a fairly good boxer. I became boxing coach at DePauw while I was an<br/>undergraduate. Later on, at Harvard Law, I didn’t have time to keep it up, and I never boxed seriously<br/>again. But I don’t think that for me boxing was an expression of combativeness for its own sake. I<br/>think I considered competence at defending yourself a means of preserving your personal<br/>independence. I learned that from my father. ‘Be your own man,’ he used to say. He’d come from<br/>Austria-Hungary, the part that’s now eastern Czechoslovakia, in the eighteen-eighties, when he was<br/>about twenty, and he spent his adult life as a storekeeper in various Middle Western towns: Morton,<br/>Illinois, where I was born; Valparaiso, Indiana; Springfield, Missouri; Michigan City and, later,<br/>Winamac, Indiana. He had very pale-blue eyes that reflected the insides of him. You could tell by<br/>looking at him that he wouldn’t trade independence for security. He didn’t know how to dissemble,<br/>and wouldn’t have wanted to if he had known how. Well, to get back to my being controversial, or<br/>combative, or whatever you call it, in Washington—yes, there’s something missing when you don’t<br/>have a McKellar laying it on the line any more. The moral equivalent of that for me now is taking on<br/>challenges, different kinds of McKellars or Tacoma Tigers, maybe—the Minerals &amp; Chemicals thing,<br/>the D. &amp; R. thing—and trying to meet them.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark300"><span>I revisited Lilienthal in early summer, 1968, this time at D. &amp; R.’s third home office, a suite with a<br/>splendid harbor view at I Whitehall Street. Both D. &amp; R. and he had moved along in the interim. In<br/>Khuzistan, the Dez Dam had been completed on schedule; water impounding had begun in November,<br/>1962, the first power had been delivered in May, 1963, and the region was now not only supplying its<br/>own power but producing enough surplus to attract foreign industry. Meanwhile, agriculture in the<br/>once-barren region was flourishing as a result of irrigation made possible by the dam, and, as<br/>Lilienthal—sixty-eight now, and as combative as ever—put it, “The gloomy economists have to be<br/>gloomy about some other underdeveloped country.” D. &amp; R. had just signed a new five-year contract<br/>with Iran to carry on the work. Otherwise, the firm had expanded its clientele to include fourteen<br/>countries; its most controversial undertaking was in Vietnam, where, under contract with the United<br/>States government, it was cooperating with a similar group of South Vietnamese in working up plans<br/>for the postwar development of the Mekong Valley. (This assignment had led to criticism of Lilienthal<br/>by those who took it to imply that he supported the war; in fact, he told me, he regarded the war as the<br/>disastrous outcome of a series of “horrible miscalculations,” and the planning of postwar resources<br/>development as a separate matter. It was clear enough, nevertheless, that the criticism hurt. At the<br/>same time, D. &amp; R. was widening its horizons by beginning to move, unexpectedly, into domestic<br/>urban development, having been engaged by private foundation-sponsored groups in Queens County,<br/>New York and Oakland County, Michigan to see whether the T.V.A. approach might have some value<br/>in dealing with those modern deserts, the slums. “Just pretend this is Zambia and tell us what you<br/>would do,” these groups had said, in effect, to D. &amp; R.—a wildly imaginative idea, surely, the<br/>usefulness of which remained to be proved.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>As for D. &amp; R. itself and its place in American business, Lilienthal recounted that since I had seen<br/>him it had expanded to the extent of opening a second permanent office on the West Coast, had<br/>considerably increased its profits, and become essentially employee-owned, with Lazard retaining<br/>only a token interest. Most encouraging of all, at a time when old-line business was having serious</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>recruitment problems because its obsession with profit was repelling high-minded youth, D. &amp; R.<br/>found that its idealistic objectives made it a magnet for the most promising new graduates. And as a<br/>result of all these things, Lillienthal could at last say what he had not been able to say on the earlier<br/>occasion—that private enterprise was now affording him more satisfaction than he had ever derived<br/>from public service.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Is D. &amp; R., then, a prototype of the free enterprise of the future, accountable half to its stockholders<br/>and half to the rest of humanity? If so, then the irony is complete, and Lilienthal, of all people, ends up<br/>as the prototypical businessman.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l3"><li><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark301">For a detailed discussion of stock options, see p. 101.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark302">This part of Lilienthal’s journal was eventually published, in 1966.</a></p></li></ul><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark303">10</a><a name="bookmark304">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark305">Stockholder Season</a><a name="bookmark306">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark307"><span class="s6">A FEW YEARS AGO, </span></a>a European diplomat was quoted in the <i>Times </i><span>as saying, “The American economy<br/>has become so big that it is beyond the imagination to comprehend. But now on top of size you are<br/>getting rapid growth as well. It is a situation of fundamental power unequalled in the history of the<br/>world.” At about the same time, A. A. Berle wrote, in a study of corporate power, that the five<br/>hundred or so corporations that dominate that economy “represent a concentration of power over<br/>economics which makes the medieval feudal system look like a Sunday-school party.” As for the<br/>power within those corporations, it clearly rests, for all practical purposes, with their directors and<br/>their professional managers (often not substantial owners), who, Berle goes on to suggest in the same<br/>essay, sometimes constitute a self-perpetuating oligarchy. Most fair-minded observers these days<br/>seem to feel that the stewardship of the oligarchs, from a social point of view, isn’t anything like as<br/>bad as it might be, and in many cases is pretty good, yet, however that may be, the ultimate power<br/>theoretically does not reside in them at all. According to the corporate form of organization, it resides<br/>in the stockholders, of whom, in United States business enterprises of all sizes and descriptions, there<br/>are more than twenty million. Even though the courts have repeatedly ruled that a director does not<br/>have to follow stockholder instructions, any more than a congressman has to follow the instructions of<br/>his constituents, stockholders nevertheless do elect directors, on the logical, if not exactly<br/>democratic, basis of one share, one vote. The stockholders are deprived of their real power by a<br/>number of factors, among which are their indifference to it in times of rising profits and dividends,<br/>their ignorance of corporate affairs, and their sheer numbers. One way or another, they vote the<br/>management slate, and the results of most director elections have a certain Russian ring—ninety-nine<br/>per cent or more of the votes cast in favor. The chief, and in many cases the only, occasion when<br/>stockholders make their presence felt by management is at the annual meeting. Company annual<br/>meetings are customarily held in the spring, and one spring—it was that of 1966—I made the rounds<br/>of a few of them to get a line on what the theoretical holders of all that feudal power had to say for<br/>themselves, and also on the state of their relations with their elected directors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark308"><span>What particularly commended the 1966 season to me was that it promised to be a particularly<br/>lively one. Various reports of a new “hard-line approach” by company managements to stockholders<br/>had appeared in the press. (I was charmed by the notion of a candidate for office announcing his new<br/>hard-line approach to voters right before an election.) The new approach, it was reported, was the<br/>upshot of events at the previous year’s meetings, where a new high in stockholder unruliness was<br/>reached. The chairman of the Communications Satellite Corporation was forced to call on guards to<br/>eject bodily two badgering stockholders at his company’s meeting, in Washington. Harland C.<br/>Forbes, who was then the chairman of Consolidated Edison, ordered one heckler off the premises in<br/>New York, and, in Philadelphia, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Chairman Frederick R. Kappel</span></a><a name="bookmark309">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>was goaded into announcing abruptly, “This meeting is not being run by Robert’s [Rules of Order].<br/>It’s being run by me.” (The executive director of the American Society of Corporate Secretaries later<br/>explained that precise application of Robert’s rules would have had the effect not of increasing the<br/>stockholders’ freedom of speech but, rather, of restricting it. Mr. Kappel, the secretary implied, had<br/>merely been protecting stockholders from parliamentary tyranny.) In Schenectady, Gerald L.<br/>Phillippe, chairman of General Electric, after several hours of fencing with stockholders, summed up<br/>his new hard line by saying, “I should like it to be clear that next year, and in the years to come, the<br/>chair may well adopt a more rigorous attitude.” According to </span><i>Business Week </i><span>, the General Electric<br/>management then assigned a special task force to the job of seeing what could be done about cracking<br/>down on hecklers by changing the annual-meeting pattern, and early in 1966 the bible of management,<br/>the </span><i>Harvard Business Review</i><span>, entered the lists with an article by O. Glenn Saxon, Jr., the head of a<br/>company specializing in investor services to management, in which he recommended crisply that the<br/>chairmen of annual meetings “recognize the authority inherent in the role of the chair, and resolve to<br/>use it appropriately.” Apparently, the theoretical holders of fundamental power unequalled in the<br/>history of the world were about to be put in their place.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark310">ONE </a><span class="p">thing I couldn’t help noticing as I went over the schedule of the year’s leading meetings was a<br/>trend away from holding them in or near New York. Invariably, the official reason given was that the<br/>move would accommodate stockholders from other areas who had seldom, if ever, been able to<br/>attend in the past; however, most of the noisiest dissident stockholders seem to be based in the New<br/>York area, and the moves were taking place in the year of the new hard line, so I found the likelihood<br/>of a relationship between these two facts by no means remote. United States Steel holders, for<br/>example, were to meet in Cleveland, making their second foray outside their company’s nominal<br/>home state of New Jersey since its formation, in 1901. General Electric was going outside New York<br/>State for the third time in recent years—and going all the way to Georgia, a state in which<br/>management appeared to have suddenly discovered fifty-six hundred stockholders (or a bit more than<br/>one per cent of the firm’s total roll) who were badly in need of a chance to attend an annual meeting.<br/>The biggest company of them all, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, had chosen Detroit, which was<br/>its third site outside New York City in its eighty-one-year history, the second having been<br/>Philadelphia, where the 1965 session was held.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark311"><span>To open my own meeting-going season, I tracked A.T.&amp; T. to Detroit. Leafing through some papers<br/>on the plane going out there, I learned that the number of A.T. &amp; T. stockholders had increased to an<br/>all-time record of almost three million, and I fell to wondering what would happen in the unlikely<br/>event that all of them, or even half of them, appeared in Detroit and demanded seats at the meeting. At<br/>any rate, each one of them had received by mail, a few weeks earlier, a notice of the meeting along<br/>with a formal invitation to attend, and it seemed to me almost certain that American industry had<br/>achieved another “first”—the first time almost three million individual invitations had ever been<br/>mailed out to any event of any kind anywhere. My fears on the first score were put to rest when I got<br/>to Cobo Hall, a huge riverfront auditorium, where the meeting was to take place. The hall was far<br/>from filled; the Yankees in their better days would have been disgusted with such a turnout on any<br/>weekday afternoon. (The papers next day said the attendance was four thousand and sixteen.) Looking<br/>around, I noticed in the crowd several families with small children, one woman in a wheelchair, one<br/>man with a beard, and just two Negro stockholders—the last observation suggesting that the<br/>trumpeters of “people’s capitalism” might well do some coordinating with the civil-rights movement.<br/>The announced time of the meeting was one-thirty, and Chairman Kappel entered on the dot and</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>marched to a reading stand on the platform; the eighteen other A.T. &amp; T. directors trooped to a row of<br/>seats just behind him, and Mr. Kappel gavelled the meeting to order.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark312"><span>From my reading and from annual meetings that I’d attended in past years, I knew that the meetings<br/>of the biggest companies are usually marked by the presence of so-called professional stockholders—<br/>persons who make a full-time occupation of buying stock in companies or obtaining the proxies of<br/>other stockholders, then informing themselves more or less intimately about the corporations’ affairs<br/>and attending annual meetings to raise questions or propose resolutions—and that the most celebrated<br/>members of this breed were Mrs. Wilma Soss, of New York, who heads an organization of women<br/>stockholders and votes the proxies of its members as well as her own shares, and Lewis D. Gilbert,<br/>also of New York, who represents his own holdings and those of his family—a considerable total.<br/>Something I did not know, and learned at the A.T. &amp; T. meeting (and at others I attended<br/>subsequently), was that, apart from the prepared speeches of management, a good many big-company<br/>meetings really consist of a dialogue—in some cases it’s more of a duel—between the chairman and<br/>the few professional stockholders. The contributions of non-professionals run strongly to ill-informed<br/>or tame questions and windy encomiums of management, and thus the task of making cogent criticisms<br/>or asking embarrassing questions falls to the professionals. Though largely self-appointed, they<br/>become, by default, the sole representatives of a huge constituency that may badly need representing.<br/>Some of them are not very good representatives, and a few are so bad that their conduct raises a<br/>problem in American manners; these few repeatedly say things at annual meetings—boorish, silly,<br/>insulting, or abusive things—that are apparently permissible by corporate rules but are certainly<br/>impermissible by drawing-room rules, and sometimes succeed in giving the annual meetings of mighty<br/>companies the general air of barnyard squabbles. Mrs. Soss, a former public-relations woman who<br/>has been a tireless professional stockholder since 1947, is usually a good many cuts above this level.<br/>True, she is not beyond playing to the gallery by wearing bizarre costumes to meetings; she tries, with<br/>occasional success, to taunt recalcitrant chairmen into throwing her out; she is often scolding and<br/>occasionally abusive; and nobody could accuse her of being unduly concise. I confess that her<br/>customary tone and manner set my teeth on edge, but I can’t help recognizing that, because she does<br/>her homework, she usually has a point. Mr. Gilbert, who has been at it since 1933 and is the dean of<br/>them all, almost invariably has a point, and by comparison with his colleagues he is the soul of<br/>brevity and punctilio as well as of dedication and diligence. Despised as professional stockholders<br/>are by most company managements, Mrs. Soss and Mr. Gilbert are widely enough recognized to be<br/>listed in </span></a><i>Who’s Who in America; </i><span>furthermore, for what satisfaction it may bring them, they are the<br/>nameless Agamemnons and Ajaxes, invariably called “individuals,” in some of the prose epics<br/>produced by the business Establishment itself. (“The greater portion of the discussion period was<br/>taken up by questions and statements of a few individuals on matters that can scarcely be deemed<br/>relevant.… Two individuals interrupted the opening statement of the chairman.… The chairman<br/>advised the individuals who had interrupted to choose between ceasing their interruption or leaving<br/>the meeting.…” So reads, in part, the official report of the 1965 A.T. &amp; T. annual meeting.) And<br/>although Mr. Saxon’s piece in the </span><i>Harvard Business Review </i><span>was entirely about professional<br/>stockholders and how to deal with them, the author’s corporate dignity did not permit him to mention<br/>the name of even one of them. Avoiding this was quite a trick, but Mr. Saxon pulled it off.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark313"><span>Both Mrs. Soss and Mr. Gilbert were present at Cobo Hall. Indeed, the meeting had barely got<br/>under way before Mr. Gilbert was on his feet complaining that several resolutions he had asked the<br/>company to include in the proxy statement and the meeting agenda had been omitted from both. Mr.<br/>Kappel—a stern-looking man with steel-rimmed spectacles, who was unmistakably cast in the old-</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>fashioned, aloof corporate mold, rather than the new, more permissive one—replied shortly that the<br/>Gilbert proposals had referred to matters that were not proper for stockholder consideration, and had<br/>been submitted too late, anyhow. Mr. Kappel then announced that he was about to report on company<br/>operations, whereupon the eighteen other directors filed off the platform. Evidently, they had been<br/>there only to be introduced, not to field questions from stockholders. Exactly where they went I don’t<br/>know; they vanished from my field of vision, and I wasn’t enlightened when, later on in the meeting,<br/>Mr. Kappel responded to a stockholder’s question as to their whereabouts with the laconic statement<br/>“They’re here.” Going it alone, Mr. Kappel said in his report that “business is booming, earnings are<br/>good, and the prospect ahead is for more of the same,” declared that A.T. &amp; T. was eager for the<br/>Federal Communications Commission to get on with its investigation of telephone rates, since the<br/>company had “no skeletons in the closet,” and then painted a picture of a bright telephonic future in<br/>which “picture phones” will be commonplace and light beams will carry messages.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>When Mr. Kappel’s address was over and the management-sponsored slate of directors for the<br/>coming year had been duly nominated, Mrs. Soss rose to make a nomination of her own—Dr. Frances<br/>Arkin, a psychoanalyst. In explanation, Mrs. Soss said that she felt A.T. &amp; T. ought to have a woman<br/>on its board, and that, furthermore, she sometimes felt some of the company’s executives would be<br/>benefited by occasional psychiatric examinations. (This remark seemed to me gratuitous, but the<br/>balance of manners between bosses and stockholders was subsequently redressed, at least to my<br/>mind, at another meeting, when the chairman suggested that some of his firm’s stockholders ought to<br/>see a psychiatrist.) The nomination of Dr. Arkin was seconded by Mr. Gilbert, although not until Mrs.<br/>Soss, who was sitting a couple of seats from him, had reached over and nudged him vigorously in the<br/>ribs. Presently, a professional stockholder named Evelyn Y. Davis protested the venue of the meeting,<br/>complaining that she had been forced to come all the way from New York by bus. Mrs. Davis, a<br/>brunette, was the youngest and perhaps the best-looking of the professional stockholders but, on the<br/>basis of what I saw at the A.T. &amp; T. meeting and others, not the best informed or the most temperate,<br/>serious-minded, or worldly-wise. On this occasion, she was greeted by thunderous boos, and when<br/>Mr.      Kappel answered her by saying, “You’re out of order. You’re just talking to the wind,” he was<br/>loudly cheered. It was only then that I understood the nature of the advantage that the company had<br/>gained by moving its meeting away from New York: it had not succeeded in shaking off the gadflies,<br/>but it had succeeded in putting them in a climate where they were subject to the rigors of that great<br/>American emotion, regional pride. A lady in a flowered hat who said she was from Des Plaines,<br/>Illinois, emphasized the point by rising to say, “I wish some of the people here would behave like<br/>intelligent adults, rather than two-year-olds.” (Prolonged applause.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Even so, the sniping from the East went on, and by three-thirty, when the meeting had been in<br/>session for two hours, Mr. Kappel was clearly getting testy; he began pacing impatiently around the<br/>platform, and his answers got shorter and shorter. “O.K., O.K.” was all he replied to one complaint<br/>that he was dictatorial. The climax came in a wrangle between him and Mrs. Soss about the fact that</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>A.T. &amp; T., although it had listed the business affiliations of its nominees for director in a pamphlet<br/>that was handed out at the meeting, had failed to list  them in the material mailed out to the<br/>stockholders, the overwhelming majority of whom were not at the meeting and had done their voting<br/>by proxy. Most other big companies make such disclosures in their mailed proxy statements, so the<br/>stockholders were apparently entitled to a reasonable explanation of why A.T. &amp; T. had failed to do<br/>so, but somewhere along the way reason was left behind. As the exchange progressed, Mrs. Soss<br/>adopted a scolding tone and Mr. Kappel an icy one; as for the crowd, it was having a fine time booing<br/>the Christian, if that is what Mrs. Soss represented, and cheering the lion, if that is what Mr. Kappel</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark314"><span>represented. “I can’t hear you, sir,” Mrs. Soss said at one point. “Well, if you’d just listen instead of<br/>talking—” Mr. Kappel returned. Then Mrs. Soss said something I didn’t catch, and it must have been<br/>a telling bit of chairman-baiting, because Mr. Kappel’s manner changed completely, from ice to fire;<br/>he began shaking his finger and saying he wouldn’t stand for any more abuse, and the floor<br/>microphone that Mrs. Soss had been using was abruptly turned off. Followed at a distance of ten or<br/>fifteen feet by a uniformed security guard, and to the accompaniment of deafening booing and<br/>stamping, Mrs. Soss marched up the aisle and took a stand in front of the platform, facing Mr. Kappel,<br/>who informed her that he knew she wanted him to have her thrown out and that he declined to comply.<br/>Eventually, Mrs. Soss went back to her seat and everybody calmed down. The rest of the meeting,<br/>given over largely to questions and comments from amateur stockholders, rather than professional<br/>ones, was certainly less lively than what had gone before, and not noticeably higher in intellectual<br/>content. Stockholders from Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Ann Arbor all expressed the view that it<br/>would be best to let the directors run the company, although the Grand Rapids man objected mildly<br/>that the “Bell Telephone Hour” couldn’t be received on television in his locality anymore. A man<br/>from Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, spoke up for retired stockholders who would like A.T. &amp; T. to plow<br/>less of its earnings back into expansion, so that it could pay higher dividends. A stockholder from<br/>rural Louisiana stated that when he picked up his telephone lately, the operator didn’t answer for five<br/>or ten minutes. “Ah brang it to your attention,” the Louisiana man said, and Mr. Kappel promised to<br/>have somebody look into the matter. Mrs. Davis raised a complaint about A.T. &amp; T.’s contributions to<br/>charity, giving Mr. Kappel the opportunity to reply that he was glad the world contained people more<br/>charitable than she. (Tax-exempt applause.) A Detroit man said, “I hope you won’t let the abuse<br/>you’ve been subjected to by a few malcontents keep you from bringing the meeting back to the great<br/>Midwest again.” It was announced that Dr. Arkin had been defeated for a seat on the board, since she<br/>had received a vote of only 19,106 shares against some four hundred million, proxy votes included,<br/>for each candidate on the management slate. (By approving the management slate, a proxy voter can,<br/>in effect, oppose a floor nomination, even though he knows nothing about it.) And that was how the<br/>1966 annual meeting of the world’s largest company went—or how it went until five-thirty, when all<br/>but a few hundred stockholders had left, and when I headed for the airport to catch a plane back to</span></a><a name="bookmark315">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">New York.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THE <span class="p">A.T. &amp; T. meeting left me in a thoughtful mood. Annual meetings, I reflected, can be times to try<br/>the soul of an admirer of representative democratic government, especially when he finds himself<br/>guiltily sympathizing with the chairman who is being badgered from the floor. The professional<br/>stockholders, in their wilder moments, are management’s secret weapon; a Mrs. Soss and a Mrs.<br/>Davis at their most strident could have made Commodore Vanderbilt and Pierpont Morgan seem like<br/>affable old gentlemen, and they can make a latter-day magnate like Mr. Kappel seem like a henpecked<br/>husband, if not actually a champion of stockholders’ rights. At such moments, the professional<br/>stockholders become, from a practical standpoint, enemies of intelligent dissent. On the other hand, I<br/>thought, they deserve sympathy, too, whether or not one believes they have right on their side, because<br/>they are in the position of representing a constituency that doesn’t want to be represented. It’s hard to<br/>imagine anyone more reluctant to claim his democratic rights, or more suspicious of anyone who tries<br/>to claim them for him, than a dividend-fattened stockholder—and, of course, most stockholders are<br/>thoroughly dividend-fattened these days. Berle speaks of the estate of stockholding as being by its<br/>nature “passive-receptive,” rather than “managing and creating;” most of the A.T. &amp; T. stockholders<br/>in Detroit, it seemed to me, were so deeply devoted to the notion of the company as Santa Claus that</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>they went beyond passive receptivity to active cupboard love. And the professional stockholders, I<br/>felt, had taken on an assignment almost as thankless as that of recruiting for the Young Communist<br/>League among the junior executives of the Chase Manhattan Bank.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark316"><span>In view of Chairman Phillippe’s warning to General Electric stockholders at Schenectady in 1965,<br/>and of the report about the company’s hard-line task force, it was with a sense of being engaged in hot<br/>pursuit that I boarded a southbound Pullman for the General Electric annual meeting. This one was<br/>held in Atlanta’s Municipal Auditorium, a snappy hall, the rear of which was brightened by an<br/>interior garden complete with trees and a lawn, and in spite of the fact that it was held on a<br/>languorous, rainy Southern spring morning, more than a thousand G.E. stockholders turned out. As far<br/>as I could see, three of them were Negroes, and it was not long before I saw that another of them was<br/>Mrs. Soss.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark317"><span>However exasperated he may have become the previous year in Schenectady, Mr. Phillippe, who<br/>also conducted the 1966 meeting, was in perfect control of himself and of the situation this time<br/>around. Whether he was expatiating on the wonders of G.E.’s balance sheet and its laboratory<br/>discoveries or sparring with the professional stockholders, he spoke in the same singsong way,<br/>delicately treading the thin line between patient, careful exposition and irony. Mr. Saxon, in his<br/></span></a><i>Harvard Business Review </i><span>article, had written, “Top executives are finding it necessary to learn how<br/>to lessen the adverse impact of the few disrupters on the majority of shareowners, while<br/>simultaneously enhancing the positive effects of the good things which do take place in the annual<br/>meeting,” and, having learned sometime earlier that the same Mr. Saxon had been engaged by G.E. as<br/>an adviser on stockholder relations, I couldn’t help suspecting that Mr. Philippe’s performance was a<br/>demonstration of Saxonism in action. The professional stockholders, for their part, responded by<br/>adopting precisely the same ambiguous style, and the resulting dialogue had the general air of a<br/>conversation between two people who have quarrelled and then decided, not quite wholeheartedly, to<br/>make it up. (The professional stockholders might have demanded to know how much money G.E. had<br/>spent in the interest of keeping them under control, but they missed the chance.) One of the exchanges<br/>in this vein achieved a touch of wit. Mrs. Soss, speaking in her sweetest tone, called attention to the<br/>fact that one of the board-of-directors candidates—Frederick L. Hovde, President of Purdue<br/>University and former chairman of the Army Scientific Advisory Panel—owned only ten shares of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>G.E. stock, and said she felt that the board should be made up of more substantial holders, whereupon<br/>Mr. Philippe pointed out, just as sweetly, that the company had many thousands of holders of ten or<br/>fewer shares, Mrs. Soss among them, and suggested that perhaps these small holders were deserving<br/>of representation on the board by one of their number. Mrs. Soss had to concede a fine stroke of<br/>chairmanship, and she did. On another matter, although decorum was stringently maintained by both<br/>sides, outward accord was less complete. Several stockholders, Mrs. Soss among them, had formally<br/>proposed that the company adopt for its director elections the system called cumulative voting, under<br/>which a stockholder may concentrate all the votes he is entitled to on a single candidate rather than<br/>spread them over the whole slate, and which therefore gives a minority group of stockholders a much<br/>better chance of electing one representative to the board. Cumulative voting, though a subject of<br/>controversy in big-business circles, for obvious reasons, is nevertheless a perfectly respectable idea;<br/>indeed, it is mandatory for companies incorporated in more than twenty states, and it is used by some<br/>four hundred companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, Mr. Phillippe did not<br/>find it necessary to answer Mrs. Soss’s argument for cumulative voting; he chose instead to stand on a<br/>brief company statement on this subject that had been previously mailed out to stockholders, the main<br/>point of which was that the presence on the G.E. board, as a result of cumulative voting, of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>representatives of special-interest groups might have a “divisive and disruptive effect.” Of course,<br/>Mr. Phillippe did not say he knew, as he doubtless did know, that the company had in hand more than<br/>enough proxies to defeat the proposal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark318"><span>Some companies, like some animals, have their private, highly specialized gadflies, who harass<br/>them and nobody else, and General Electric is one. In this instance, the gadfly was Louis A. Brusati,<br/>of Chicago, who at the company’s meetings over the past thirteen years had advanced thirty-one<br/>proposals, all of which had been defeated by a vote of at least ninety-seven per cent to three per cent.<br/>In Atlanta, Mr. Brusati, a gray-haired man built like a football player, was at it again—not with<br/>proposals this time but with questions. For one thing, he wanted to know why Mr. Phillippe’s<br/>personal holdings of G.E. stock, listed in the proxy statement, now were four hundred and twenty-<br/>three shares fewer than they had been a year ago. Mr. Phillippe replied that the difference represented<br/>shares that he had contributed to family trust funds, and added, mildly but with emphasis, “I could say<br/>it’s none of your business. I believe I have a right to the privacy of my affairs.” There was more<br/>reason for the mildness than for the emphasis, as Mr. Brusati did not fail to point out, in an<br/>impeccably unemotional monotone; many of Mr. Phillippe’s shares had been acquired under options<br/>at preferential prices not available to others, and, moreover, the fact that Mr. Phillippe’s precise<br/>holdings had been included in the proxy statement clearly showed that in the opinion of the Securities<br/>and Exchange Commission his holdings </span></a><i>were </i><span>Mr. Brusati’s business. Going on to the matter of the<br/>fees paid directors, Mr. Brusati elicited from Mr. Phillippe the information that over the past seven<br/>years these had been raised from twenty-five hundred dollars per annum first to five thousand dollars<br/>and then to seventy-five hundred. The ensuing dialogue between the two men went like this:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“By the way, who establishes those fees?”</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>“Those fees are established by the board of directors.”<br/>“The board of directors establish their own fees?”<br/>“Yes.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Thank you.”</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Thank <i>you</i>, Mr. Brusati.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Later on in the morning, there were several lengthy and eloquent orations by stockholders on the<br/>virtues of General Electric and of the South, but this rather elegantly elliptical exchange between Mr.<br/>Brusati and Mr. Phillippe stuck in my mind, for it seemed to sum up the spirit of the meeting. Only<br/>after adjournment—which came at twelve-thirty, following Mr. Phillippe’s announcement that the<br/>unopposed slate of directors had been elected and that cumulative voting had lost by 97.51 per cent to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>2.49 per cent—did I realize that not only had there been no stamping, booing, or shouting, as there had<br/>been in Detroit, but regional pride had not had to be invoked against the professional stockholders. It<br/>had been General Electric’s hole card, I felt, but General Electric had won on the board, without<br/>needing to turn it up.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EACH <span class="p">meeting I attended had its easily discernible characteristic tone, and that of Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co.,<br/>the diversified pharmaceutical and chemical firm, was amicability. Pfizer, which in previous years<br/>had customarily held its annual meeting at its headquarters in Brooklyn, reversed the trend by moving<br/>this year’s meeting right into the lair of the most vocal dissenters, midtown Manhattan, but everything<br/>that I saw and heard convinced me that the motivation behind this move had been not a brash resolve<br/>on the company’s part to beard the lions in their den but a highly unfashionable desire to get the<br/>maximum possible turnout. Pfizer seemed to feel self-confident enough to meet its stockholders with<br/>its guard down. For instance, in contrast with the other meetings I attended, no stockholder tickets</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>were collected or credentials checked at the entrance to the Grand Ballroom of the Commodore<br/>Hotel, where the Pfizer meeting was held; Fidel Castro himself, whose oratorical style I have<br/>occasionally felt that the professional stockholders were using as a model, could presumably have<br/>walked in and said whatever he chose. Some seventeen hundred persons, or nearly enough to fill the<br/>ballroom, showed up, and all the members of the Pfizer board of directors sat on the platform from<br/>start to finish and answered any questions addressed to them individually.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark319"><span>Speaking, appropriately, with a faint trace of a Brooklyn accent, Chairman John E. McKeen<br/>welcomed the stockholders as “my dear and cherished friends” (I tried to imagine Mr. Kappel and<br/>Mr. Phillippe addressing their stockholders that way, and couldn’t, but then their companies are<br/>bigger), and said that on the way out everyone present would be given a big free-sample kit of Pfizer<br/>consumer products, such as Barbasol, Desitin, and Imprévu. Wooed thus by endearments and the<br/>promise of gifts, and further softened up by the report of President John J. Powers, Jr., on current<br/>operations (records all around) and immediate prospects (more records expected), the most<br/>intransigent professional stockholder would have been hard put to it to mount much of a rebellion at<br/>this particular meeting, and, as it happened, the only professional present seemed to be John Gilbert,<br/>brother of Lewis. (I learned later that Lewis Gilbert and Mrs. Davis were in Cleveland that day,<br/>attending the U.S. Steel meeting.) John Gilbert is the sort of professional stockholder the Pfizer<br/>management deserves, or would like to think it does. With an easygoing manner and a habit of<br/>punctuating his words with self-deprecating little laughs, he is the most ingratiating gadfly imaginable<br/>(or was on this occasion; I’m told he isn’t always), and as he ran through what seemed to be the<br/>standard Gilbert-family repertoire of questions—on the reliability of the firm’s auditors, the salaries<br/>of its officers, the fees of its directors—he seemed almost apologetic that duty called on him to<br/>commit the indelicacy of asking such things. As for the amateur stockholders present, their questions<br/>and comments were about like those at the other meetings I’d attended, but this time their attitude<br/>toward the role of the professional stockholder was noticeably different. Instead of being<br/>overwhelmingly opposed, they appeared to be split; to judge from the volume of clapping and of<br/>discreet groaning, about half of those present considered Gilbert a nuisance and half considered him a<br/>help. Powers left no doubt about how </span></a><i>he </i><span>felt; before adjourning the meeting he said, without irony,<br/>that he had welcomed Gilbert’s questions, and made a point of inviting him to come again next year.<br/>And, indeed, during the later stages of the Pfizer meeting, when Gilbert, in a conversational way, was<br/>praising the company for some things and criticizing it for others, and the various members of the<br/>board were replying to his comments just as informally, I got for the first time a fleeting sense of<br/>genuine communication between stockholders and managers.</span><a name="bookmark320">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THE <span class="p">Radio Corporation of America, which had held its last two meetings far from its New York<br/>headquarters—in Los Angeles in 1964, in Chicago in 1965—reserved the current trend even more<br/>decisively than Pfizer by convening this time in Carnegie Hall. The entire orchestra and the two tiers<br/>of boxes were completely filled with stockholders—about twenty-three hundred of them, of whom a<br/>strikingly larger proportion than at any of my other meetings was male. Mrs. Soss and Mrs. Davis<br/>were on hand, though, along with Lewis Gilbert and some professional stockholders I hadn’t seen<br/>before, and, as with Pfizer, the company’s whole board of directors sat on the platform, where the<br/>chief centers of attraction in R.C.A.’s case were David Sarnoff, the company’s seventy-five-year-old<br/>chairman, and his forty-eight-year-old son, Robert W. Sarnoff, who had been its president since the<br/>beginning of the year. For me, two aspects of the R.C.A. meeting stood out: the evident respect,<br/>amounting almost to veneration, of the stockholders for their celebrated chairman, and an</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>unaccustomed disposition of the amateur stockholders to speak up for themselves. The elder Mr.<br/>Sarnoff, looking hale and ready for anything, conducted the meeting, and he and several other R.C.A.<br/>executives gave reports on company operations and prospects, in the course of which the words<br/>“record” and “growth” recurred so monotonously that I, not being an R.C.A. stockholder, began to<br/>nod. I was brought wide awake with a jolt on one occasion, though, when I heard Walter D. Scott,<br/>chairman of R.C.A.’s subsidiary the National Broadcasting Company, say in connection with his<br/>network’s television programming that “creative resources are always running ahead of demand.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark321"><span>No one objected to that statement or to anything else in the glowing reports, but when they were<br/>over the stockholders had their say on other matters. Mr. Gilbert raised some favorite questions of his<br/>about accounting procedures, and a representative of R.C.A.’s accountants, Arthur Young &amp; Co.,<br/>made replies that seemed to satisfy Mr. Gilbert. A Dickensian elderly lady, who identified herself as<br/>Mrs. Martha Brand and said she held “many thousands” of shares of R.C.A. stock, expressed the view<br/>that the accounting procedures of the company should not even be questioned. I have since learned<br/>that Mrs. Brand is a professional stockholder who is an anomaly within the profession, in that she<br/>leans strongly toward the management view of things. Mr. Gilbert then advanced a proposal for the<br/>adoption of cumulative voting, supporting it with about the same arguments that Mrs. Soss had used at<br/>the G.E. meeting. Mr. Sarnoff opposed the motion, and so did Mrs. Brand, who explained that she<br/>was sure the present directors always worked tirelessly for the welfare of the corporation, and added<br/>this time that she was the holder of “many, many thousands” of shares. Two or three other<br/>stockholders spoke up in favor of cumulative voting—the only occasion at any meeting on which I<br/>saw stockholders not easily identifiable as professionals speak in dissent on a matter of substance.<br/>(Cumulative voting was defeated, 95.3 per cent to 4.7 per cent.) Mrs. Soss, still in as mild a mood as<br/>in Atlanta, said she was delighted to see a woman, Mrs. Josephine Young Case, sitting on the stage as<br/>a member of the R.C.A. board, but deplored the fact that Mrs. Case’s principal occupation was given<br/>on the proxy statement as “housewife.” Couldn’t a woman who was chairman of the board of<br/>Skidmore College at least be called a “home executive”? Another lady stockholder set off a round of<br/>applause by delivering a paean to Chairman Sarnoff, whom she called “the marvellous Cinderella<br/>man of the twentieth century.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark322"><span>Mrs. Davis—who had earlier objected to the site of the meeting on the ground, which I found<br/>dumfounding, that Carnegie Hall was “too unsophisticated” for R.C.A.—advanced a resolution<br/>calling for company action “to insure that hereafter no person shall serve as a director after he shall<br/>have attained the age of seventy-two.” Even though similar rulings are in effect in many companies,<br/>and even though the proposal, not being retroactive, would have no effect upon Mr. Sarnoff’s status, it<br/></span></a><i>seemed </i><span>to be aimed at him, and thus Mrs. Davis demonstrated again her uncanny knack of playing into<br/>management’s hands. Nor did she appear to help her cause by putting on a Batman mask (the<br/>symbolism of which I didn’t grasp) when she made it. At all events, the proposal gave rise to several<br/>impassioned defenses of Mr. Sarnoff, and one of the speakers went on to complain bitterly that Mrs.<br/>Davis was insulting the intelligence of everyone present. At this, the serious-minded Mr. Gilbert<br/>leaped up to say, “I quite agree about the silliness of her costume, but there is a valid principle in her<br/>proposal.” In making this Voltairian distinction, Mr. Gilbert, to judge from his evident state of<br/>agitation, was achieving a triumph of reason over inclination that was costing him plenty. Mrs.<br/>Davis’s resolution was defeated overwhelmingly; the margin against it served to end the meeting with<br/>what amounted to a rousing vote of confidence in the Cinderella man.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CLASSIC <span class="p">farce, with elements of slapstick, was the dominant mood of the meeting of the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Communications Satellite Corporation, with which I wound up my meeting-going season. Comsat is,<br/>of course, the glamorous space-age communications company that was set up by the government in<br/>1963 and turned over to public ownership in a celebrated stock sale in 1964. Upon arriving at the<br/>meeting site—the Shoreham Hotel, in Washington—I was scarcely startled to discover Mrs. Davis,<br/>Mrs. Soss, and Lewis Gilbert among the thousand or so stockholders present. Mrs. Davis, decked out<br/>in stage makeup, an orange pith helmet, a short red skirt, white boots, and a black sweater bearing in<br/>white letters the legend “I Was Born to Raise Hell,” had planted herself squarely in front of a battery<br/>of television cameras. Mrs. Soss, as I had learned by now was her custom, had taken a place at the<br/>opposite side of the room from Mrs. Davis, and this meant that she was now as far as possible from<br/>the television cameras. Considering that Mrs. Soss does not ordinarily seem to be averse to being<br/>photographed, I could write down this choice of seat only as a hard-won triumph of conscience akin<br/>to Mr. Gilbert’s at Carnegie Hall. As for Mr. Gilbert, he took a place not far from Mrs. Soss, and<br/>thus, of course, a long way from Mrs. Davis.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark323"><span>Since the previous year, Leo D. Welch, the man who had conducted the 1965 Comsat meeting with<br/>such a firm hand, has been replaced as chairman of the company by James McCormack, a West Point<br/>graduate, former Rhodes Scholar, and retired Air Force general with an impeccably polished manner,<br/>who bears a certain resemblance to the Duke of Windsor, and Mr. McCormack was conducting this<br/>year’s session. He warmed up with some preliminary remarks in the course of which he noted—-<br/>smoothly, but not without emphasis—that as for the subject of any intervention that a stockholder<br/>might choose to make, “the field of relevance is quite narrow.” When Mr. McCormack had finished<br/>his warmup, Mrs. Soss made a brief speech that may or may not have come within the field of<br/>relevance; I missed most of it, because the floor microphone supplied to her wasn’t working right.<br/>Mrs. Davis then claimed the floor, and </span></a><i>her </i><span>mike was working all too well; as the cameras ground, she<br/>launched into an earsplitting tirade against the company and its directors because there had been a<br/>special door to the meeting room reserved for the entrance of “distinguished guests.” Mrs. Davis, in a<br/>good many words, said she considered this procedure undemocratic. “We apologize, and when you<br/>go out, please go by any door you want,” Mr. McCormack said, but Mrs. Davis, clearly unappeased,<br/>went on speaking. And now the mood of farce was heightened when it became clear that the Soss-<br/>Gilbert faction had decided to abandon all efforts to keep ranks closed with Mrs. Davis. Near the<br/>height of her oration, Mr. Gilbert, looking as outraged as a boy whose ball game is being spoiled by a<br/>player who doesn’t know the rules or care about the game, got up and began shouting, “Point of order!<br/>Point of order!” But Mr. McCormack spurned this offer of parliamentary help; he ruled Mr. Gilbert’s<br/>point of order out of order, and bade Mrs. Davis proceed. I had no trouble deducing why he did this.<br/>There were unmistakable signs that he, unlike any other corporate chairman I had seen in action, was<br/>enjoying every minute of the goings on. Through most of the meeting, and especially when the<br/>professional stockholders had the floor, Mr. McCormack wore the dreamy smile of a wholly bemused<br/>spectator.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark324"><span>Eventually, Mrs. Davis’s speech built up to a peak of both volume and content at which she began<br/>making specific allegations against individual Comsat directors, and at this point three security<br/>guards—two beefy men and a determined-looking woman, all dressed in gaudy bottle-green uniforms<br/>that might have been costumes for “The Pirates of Penzance”—appeared at the rear, marched with<br/>brisk yet stately tread up the center aisle, and assumed the position of parade rest in the aisle within<br/>handy reach of Mrs. Davis, whereupon she abruptly concluded her speech and sat down. “All right,”<br/>Mr. McCormack said, still grinning. “Everything’s cool now.”</span></a><a name="bookmark325">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The guards retired, and the meeting proceeded. Mr. McCormack and the Comsat president, Joseph</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><span>V. Charyk, gave the sort of glowing report on the company that I had grown accustomed to, Mr.<br/>McCormack going so far as to say that Comsat might start showing its first profit the following year<br/>rather than in 1969, as originally forecast. (It did.) Mr. Gilbert asked what fee, apart from his regular<br/>salary, Mr. McCormack received for attending directors’ meetings. Mr. McCormack replied that he<br/>got no fee, and when Mr. Gilbert said, “I’m glad you get nothing, I approve of that,” everybody<br/>laughed and Mr. McCormack grinned more broadly than ever. (Mr. Gilbert was clearly trying to make<br/>what he considered to be a serious point, but this didn’t seem to be the day for that sort of thing.) Mrs.<br/>Soss took a dig at Mrs. Davis by saying pointedly that anyone who opposed Mr. McCormack as<br/>company chairman was “lacking in perspicacity;” she did note, however, that she couldn’t quite bring<br/>herself to vote for Mr. Welch, the former chairman, who was now a candidate for the board,<br/>inasmuch as he had ordered her thrown out last year. A peppy old gentleman said that he thought the<br/>company was doing fine and everyone should have faith in it. Once, when Mr. Gilbert said something<br/>that Mrs. Davis didn’t like and Mrs. Davis, without waiting to be recognized, began shouting her<br/>objection across the room, Mr. McCormack gave a short irrepressible giggle. That single falsetto<br/>syllable, magnificently amplified by the chairman’s microphone, was the motif of the Comsat meeting.<br/>On the plane returning from Washington, as I was musing on the meetings I had attended, it<br/>occurred to me that if there had been no professional stockholders at them I would probably have<br/>learned almost as much as I did about the companies’ affairs but that I would have learned a good<br/>deal less about their chief executives’ personalities. It had, after all, been the questions, interruptions,<br/>and speeches of the professional stockholders that brought the companies to life, in a sense, by<br/>forcing each chairman to shed his official portrait-by-Bachrach mask and engage in a human<br/>relationship. More often than not, this had been the hardly satisfactory human relationship of nagger<br/>and nagged, but anyone looking for humanity in high corporate affairs can’t afford to pick and choose.<br/>Still, some doubts remained. Being thirty thousand feet up in the air is conducive to taking the broader<br/>view, and, doing so as we winged over Philadelphia, I concluded that, on the basis of what I had seen<br/>and heard, both company managements and stockholders might well consider a lesson King Lear<br/>learned—that when the role of dissenter is left to the Fool, there may be trouble ahead for everybody.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark326">11</a><a name="bookmark327">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark328">One Free Bite</a><a name="bookmark329">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark330"><span class="s6">AMONG THE THOUSANDS </span></a><span>of young scientists who were doing very well in the research-and-<br/>development programs of American companies in the fall of 1962 was one named Donald W.<br/>Wohlgemuth, who was working for the B. F. Goodrich Company, in Akron, Ohio. A 1954 graduate of<br/>the University of Michigan, where he had taken the degree of Bachelor of Science in chemical<br/>engineering, he had gone directly from the university to a job in the chemical laboratories of<br/>Goodrich, at a starting salary of three hundred and sixty-five dollars a month. Since then, except for<br/>two years spent in the Army, he had worked continuously for Goodrich, in various engineering and<br/>research capacities, and had received a total of fifteen salary increases over the six and a half years.<br/>In November, 1962, as he approached his thirty-first birthday, he was earning $10,644 a year. A tall,<br/>self-contained, serious-looking man of German ancestry, whose horn-rimmed glasses gave him an<br/>owlish expression, Wohlgemuth lived in a ranch house in Wadsworth, a suburb of Akron, with his<br/>wife and their fifteen-month-old daughter. All in all, he seemed to be the young American </span><i>homme</i><span>to the point of boredom. What was decidedly not routine about him, though, was the<br/>nature of his job; he was the manager of Goodrich’s department of space-suit engineering, and over<br/>the past years, in the process of working his way up to that position, he had had a considerable part in<br/>the designing and construction of the suits worn by our Mercury astronauts on their orbital and<br/>suborbital flights.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Then, in the first week of November, Wohlgemuth got a phone call from an employment agent in<br/>New York, who informed him that the executives of a large company in Dover, Delaware, were most<br/>anxious to talk to him about the possibility of his taking a job with them. Despite the caller’s reticence</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark331"><span>—a trait common among employment agents making first approaches to prospective employees—<br/>Wohlgemuth instantly knew the identity of the large company. The International Latex Corporation,<br/>which is best known to the public as a maker of girdles and brassiéres, but which Wohlgemuth knew<br/>to be also one of Goodrich’s three major competitors in the space-suit field, is situated in Dover. He<br/>knew, further, that Latex had recently been awarded a subcontract, amounting to some three-quarters<br/>of a million dollars, to do research and development on space suits for the Apollo, or man-on-the-<br/>moon, project. As a matter of fact, Latex had won this contract in competition with Goodrich, among<br/>others, and was thus for the moment much the hottest company in the space-suit field. On top of that,<br/>Wohlgemuth was somewhat discontented with his situation at Goodrich; for one thing, his salary,<br/>however bountiful it might seem to many thirty-year-olds, was considerably below the average for<br/>Goodrich employees of his rank, and, for another, he had been turned down not long before by the<br/>company authorities when he asked for air-conditioning or filtering to keep dust out of the plant area<br/>allocated to space-suit work. Accordingly, after making arrangements by phone with the executives<br/>mentioned by the employment agent—and they did indeed prove to be Latex men—Wohlgemuth went</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to Dover the following Sunday.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>He stayed there a day and a half, borrowing Monday from vacation time that was due him from<br/>Goodrich, and getting what he subsequently described as “a real red-carpet treatment.” He was taken<br/>on a tour of the Latex space-suit-development facilities by Leonard Shepard, director of the<br/>company’s Industrial Products Division. He was entertained at the home of Max Feller, a Latex vice-<br/>president. He was shown the Dover housing situation by another company executive. Finally, before<br/>lunch on Monday, he had a talk with all three of the Latex executives, following which—as<br/>Wohlgemuth later described the scene in court—the three “removed themselves to another room for<br/>approximately ten minutes.” When they reappeared, one of them offered Wohlgemuth the position of<br/>manager of engineering for the Industrial Products Division, which included responsibility for space-<br/>suit development, at an annual salary of $13,700, effective at the beginning of December. After getting<br/>his wife’s approval by telephone—and it was not hard to get, since she was originally from<br/>Baltimore and was delighted at the prospect of moving back to her own part of the world—<br/>Wohlgemuth accepted. He flew back to Akron that night. First thing Tuesday morning, Wohlgemuth<br/>confronted Carl Effler, his immediate boss at Goodrich, with the news that he was quitting at the end<br/>of the month to take another job.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>“Are you kidding?” Effler asked.<br/>“No, I am not,” Wohlgemuth replied.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark332"><span>Following this crisp exchange, which Wohlgemuth later reported in court, Effler, in the time-<br/>honored tradition of bereaved bosses, grumbled a bit about the difficulty of finding a qualified<br/>replacement before the end of the month. Wohlgemuth spent the rest of the day putting his<br/>department’s papers in order and clearing his desk of unfinished business, and the next morning he<br/>went to see Wayne Galloway, a Goodrich space-suit executive with whom he had worked closely<br/>and had been on the friendliest of terms for a long time; he said later that he felt he owed it to<br/>Galloway “to explain to him my side of the picture” in person, even though at the moment he was not<br/>under Galloway’s supervision in the company chain of command. Wohlgemuth began this interview<br/>by rather melodramatically handing Galloway a lapel pin in the form of a Mercury capsule, which<br/>had been awarded to him for his work on the Mercury space suits; now, he said, he felt he was no<br/>longer entitled to wear it. Why, then, Galloway asked, was he leaving? Simple enough, Wohlgemuth<br/>said—he considered the Latex offer a step up both in salary and in responsibility. Galloway replied<br/>that in making the move Wohlgemuth would be taking to Latex certain things that did not belong to him</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—specifically, knowledge of the processes that Goodrich used in making space suits. In the course of<br/>the conversation, Wohlgemuth asked Galloway what he would do if he were to receive a similar<br/>offer. Galloway replied that he didn’t know; for that matter, he added, he didn’t know what he would<br/>do if he were approached by a group who had a foolproof plan for robbing a bank. Wohlgemuth had<br/>to base his decision on loyalty and ethics, Galloway said—a remark that Wohlgemuth took as an<br/>accusation of bad faith. He lost his temper, he later explained, and gave Galloway a rash answer.<br/>“Loyalty and ethics have their price, and International Latex has paid it,” he said.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark333"><span>After that, the fat was in the fire. Later in the morning, Effler called Wohlgemuth into his office and<br/>told him it had been decided that he should leave the Goodrich premises as soon as possible, staying<br/>around only long enough to make a list of projects that were pending and to go through certain other<br/>formalities. In mid-afternoon, while Wohlgemuth was occupied with these tasks, Galloway called<br/>him and told him that the Goodrich legal department wanted to see him. In the legal department, he<br/>was asked whether he intended to use confidential information belonging to Goodrich on behalf of<br/>Latex. According to the subsequent affidavit of a Goodrich lawyer, he replied—again rashly—“How</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>are you going to prove it?” He was then advised that he was not legally free to make the move to<br/>Latex. While he was not bound to Goodrich by the kind of contract, common in American industry, in<br/>which an employee agrees not to do similar work for any competing company for a stated period of<br/>time, he had, on his return from the Army, signed a routine paper agreeing “to keep confidential all<br/>information, records, and documents of the company of which I may have knowledge because of my<br/>employment”—something Wohlgemuth had entirely forgotten until the Goodrich lawyer reminded<br/>him. Even if he had not made that agreement, the lawyer told him now, he would be prevented from<br/>going to work on space suits for Latex by established principles of trade-secrets law. Moreover, if he<br/>persisted in his plan, Goodrich might sue him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Wohlgemuth returned to his office and put in a call to Feller, the Latex vice-president he had met in<br/>Dover. While he was waiting for the call to be completed, he talked with Effler, who had come in to<br/>see him, and whose attitude toward his defection seemed to have stiffened considerably. Wohlgemuth<br/>complained that he felt at the mercy of Goodrich, which, it seemed to him, was unreasonably blocking<br/>his freedom of action, and Effler upset him further by saying that what had happened during the past<br/>forty-eight hours could not be forgotten and might well affect his future with Goodrich. Wohlgemuth,<br/>it appeared, might be sued if he left and scorned if he didn’t leave. When the Dover call came<br/>through, Wohlgemuth told Feller that in view of the new situation he would be unable to go to work<br/>for Latex.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark334"><span>That evening, however, Wohlgemuth’s prospects seemed to take a turn for the better. Home in<br/>Wadsworth, he called the family dentist, and the dentist recommended a local lawyer. Wohlgemuth<br/>told his story to the lawyer, who thereupon consulted another lawyer by phone. The two counsellors<br/>agreed that Goodrich was probably bluffing and would not really sue Wohlgemuth if he went to Latex.<br/>The next morning—Thursday—officials of Latex called him back to assure him that their firm would<br/>bear his legal expenses in the event of a lawsuit, and, furthermore, would indemnify him against any<br/>salary losses. Thus emboldened, Wohlgemuth delivered two messages within the next couple of hours</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—one in person and one by phone. He told Effler what the two lawyers had told him, and he called<br/>the legal department to report that he had now changed his mind and was going to work at<br/>International Latex after all. Later that day, after completing the cleanup job in his office, he left the<br/>Goodrich premises for good, taking with him no documents.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The following day—Friday—R. G. Jeter, general counsel of Goodrich, telephoned Emerson P.<br/>Barrett, director of industrial relations for Latex, and spoke of Goodrich’s concern for its trade<br/>secrets if  Wohlgemuth went to work there. Barrett replied that although “the work for which<br/>Wohlgemuth was hired was design and construction of space suits,” Latex was not interested in<br/>learning any Goodrich trade secrets but was “only interested in securing the general professional<br/>abilities of Mr. Wohlgemuth.” That this answer did not satisfy Jeter, or Goodrich, became manifest<br/>the following Monday. That evening, while Wohlgemuth was in an Akron restaurant called the Brown<br/>Derby, attending a farewell dinner in his honor given by forty or fifty of his friends, a waitress told<br/>him that there was a man outside who wanted to see him. The man was a deputy sheriff of Summit<br/>County, of which Akron is the seat, and when Wohlgemuth came out, the man handed him two papers.<br/>One was a summons to appear in the Court of Common Pleas on a date a week or so off. The other<br/>was a copy of a petition that had been filed in the same court that day by Goodrich, praying that<br/>Wohlgemuth be permanently enjoined from, among other things, disclosing to any unauthorized person<br/>any trade secrets belonging to Goodrich, and “performing any work for any corporation … other than<br/>plaintiff, relating to the design, manufacture and/or sale of high-altitude pressure suits, space suits<br/>and/or similar protective garments.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark335"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>need for the protection of trade secrets was fully recognized in the Middle Ages, when they were<br/>so jealously guarded by the craft guilds that the guilds’ employees were rigorously prevented from<br/>changing jobs. </span><i>Laissez-faire </i><span>industrial society, since it emphasizes the principle that the individual is<br/>entitled to rise in the world by taking the best opportunity he is offered, has been far more lenient<br/>about job-jumping, but the right of an organization to keep its secrets has survived. In American law,<br/>the basic commandment on the subject was laid down by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in<br/>connection with a 1905 Chicago case. Holmes wrote, “The plaintiff has the right to keep the work<br/>which it has done, or paid for doing, to itself. The fact that others might do similar work, if they<br/>wished, does not authorize them to steal plaintiff’s.” This admirably downright, if not highly<br/>sophisticated, ukase has been cited in almost every trade-secrets case that has come up since, but<br/>over the years, as both scientific research and industrial organization have become infinitely more<br/>complex, so have the questions of what, exactly, constitutes a trade secret, and what constitutes<br/>stealing it. The American Law Institute’s “Restatement of the Law of Torts,” an authoritative text<br/>issued in 1939, grapples manfully with the first question by stating, or restating, that “a trade secret<br/>may consist of any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information which is used in one’s<br/>business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not<br/>know or use it.” But in a case heard in 1952 an Ohio court decided that the Arthur Murray method of<br/>teaching dancing, though it was unique and was presumably helpful in luring customers away from<br/>competitors, was not a trade secret. “All of us have ‘our method’ of doing a million things—our<br/>method of combing our hair, shining our shoes, mowing our lawn,” the court mused, and concluded<br/>that a trade secret must not only be unique and commercially helpful but also have inherent value. As<br/>for what constitutes thievery of trade secrets, in a proceeding heard in Michigan in 1939, in which the<br/>Dutch Cookie Machine Company complained that one of its former employees was threatening to use<br/>its highly classified methods to make cookie machines on his own, the trial court decided that there<br/>were no fewer than three secret processes by which Dutch Cookie machines were made, and enjoined<br/>the former employee from using them in any manner; however, the Michigan Supreme Court, on<br/>appeal, found that the defendant, although he knew the three secrets, did not plan to use them in his<br/>own operations, and, accordingly, it reversed the lower court’s decision and vacated the injunction.</span><a name="bookmark336">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark337">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark338">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And so on. Outraged dancing teachers, cookie-machine manufacturers, and others have made their<br/>way through American courts, and the principles of law regarding the protection of trade secrets have<br/>become well established; any difficulty arises chiefly in the application of these principles to<br/>individual cases. The number of such cases has been rising sharply in recent years, as research and<br/>development by private industry have expanded, and a good index to the rate of such expansion is the<br/>fact that eleven and a half billion dollars was spent in this work in 1962, more than three times the<br/>figure for 1953. No company wants to see the discoveries produced by all that money go out of its<br/>doors in the attaché cases, or even in the heads, of young scientists bound for greener pastures. In<br/>nineteenth-century America, the builder of a better mousetrap was supposed to have been a cynosure</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—provided, of course, that the mousetrap was properly patented. In those days of comparatively<br/>simple technology, patents covered most proprietary rights in business, so trade-secrets cases were<br/>rare. The better mousetraps of today, however, like the processes involved in outfitting a man to go<br/>into orbit or to the moon, are often unpatentable.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Since thousands of scientists and billions of dollars might be affected by the results of the trial of<br/>Goodrich v. Wohlgemuth, it naturally attracted an unusual amount of public attention. In Akron, the<br/>court proceedings were much discussed both in the local paper, the </span><i>Beacon Journal</i><span>, and in<br/>conversation. Goodrich is an old-line company, with a strong streak of paternalism in its relations</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark339"><span>with its employees, and with strong feelings about what it regards as business ethics. “We were<br/>exceptionally upset by what Wohlgemuth did,” a Goodrich executive of long standing said recently.<br/>“In my judgment, the episode caused more concern to the company than anything that has happened in<br/>years. In fact, in the ninety-three years that Goodrich has been in business, we had never before<br/>entered a suit to restrain a former employee from disclosing trade secrets. Of course, many employees<br/>in sensitive positions have left us. But in those cases the companies doing the hiring have recognized<br/>their responsibilities. On one occasion, a Goodrich chemist went to work for another company under<br/>circumstances that made it appear to us that he was going to use our methods. We talked to the man,<br/>and to his new employer, too. The upshot was that the competing company never brought out the<br/>product it had hired our man to work on. That was responsible conduct on the part of both employee<br/>and company. As for the Wohlgemuth case, the local community and our employees were a bit hostile<br/>toward us at first—a big company suing a little guy, and so on. But they gradually came around to our<br/>point of view.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Interest outside Akron, which was evidenced by a small flood of letters of inquiry about the case,<br/>addressed to the Goodrich legal department, made it clear that Goodrich v. Wohlgemuth was being<br/>watched as a bellwether. Some inquiries were from companies that  had similar problems, or<br/>anticipated having them, and a surprising number were from relatives of young scientists, asking,<br/>“Does this mean my boy is stuck in his present job for the rest of his life?” In truth, an important issue<br/>was at stake, and pitfalls awaited the judge who heard the case, no matter which way he decided. On<br/>one side was the danger that discoveries made in the course of corporate research might become<br/>unprotectable—a situation that would eventually lead to the drying up of private research funds. On<br/>the other side  was the  danger that thousands of scientists might, through their very ability and<br/>ingenuity, find themselves permanently locked in a deplorable, and possibly unconstitutional, kind of<br/>intellectual servitude—they would be barred from changing jobs because they knew too much.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark340">THE </a><span class="p">trial—held in Akron, presided over by Judge Frank H. Harvey, and conducted, like all<br/>proceedings of its type, without a jury—began on November 26th and continued through December<br/>12th, with a week’s recess in the middle; Wohlgemuth, who was supposed to have started work at<br/>Latex on December 3rd, remained in Akron under a voluntary agreement with the court, and testified<br/>extensively in his own defense. Injunction, the form of relief that was sought by Goodrich and the<br/>chief form of relief that is available to anyone whose secrets have been stolen, is a remedy that<br/>originated in Roman law; it was anciently called “interdict,” and is still so called in Scotland. What<br/>Goodrich was asking, in effect, was that the court issue a direct order to Wohlgemuth not only<br/>forbidding him to reveal Goodrich secrets but also forbidding him to take employment in any other<br/>company’s space-suit department. Any violation of such an order would be contempt of court,<br/>punishable by a fine, or imprisonment, or both. Just how seriously Goodrich viewed the case became<br/>clear when its team of lawyers proved to be headed by Jeter  himself, who, as vice-president,<br/>secretary, the company’s ultimate authority on patent law, general law, employee relations, union<br/>relations, and workmen’s compensation, and Lord High Practically Everything Else, had not found<br/>time to try a case in court  himself for ten years. The chief defense counsel was Richard A.<br/>Chenoweth, of the Akron law firm of Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, which Latex, though it was<br/>not a defendant in the action, had retained to handle the case, in fulfillment of its promise to<br/>Wohlgemuth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>From the outset, the two sides recognized that if Goodrich was to prevail, it had to prove, first, that<br/>it possessed trade secrets; second, that Wohlgemuth also possessed them, and that a substantial peril</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark341"><span>of disclosure existed; and, third, that it would suffer irreparable injury if injunctive relief was not<br/>granted. On the first point, Goodrich attorneys, through their questioning of Effler, Galloway, and one<br/>other company employee, set out to establish that Goodrich had a number of unassailable space-suit<br/>secrets, among them a way of making the hard shell of a space helmet, a way of making the visor seal,<br/>a way of making a sock ending, a way of making the inner liner of gloves, a way of fastening the<br/>helmet onto the rest of the suit, and a way of applying a wear-resistant material called neoprene to<br/>two-way-stretch fabric. Wohlgemuth, through his counsel’s cross-examinations, sought to show that<br/>none of these processes were secrets at all; for example, in the case of the neoprene process, which<br/>Effler had described as “a very critical trade secret” of Goodrich, defense counsel brought out<br/>evidence that a Latex product that is neither secret nor intended to be worn in outer space—the<br/>Playtex Golden Girdle—was made of two-way-stretch fabric with neoprene applied to it, and, to<br/>emphasize the point, Chenoweth introduced a Playtex Golden Girdle for all to see. Nor did either<br/>side neglect to bring into court a space suit, in each instance inhabited. The Goodrich suit, a 1961<br/>model, was intended to demonstrate what the company had achieved by means of research—research<br/>that it did not want to see compromised through the loss of its secrets. The Latex suit, also a 1961<br/>model, was intended to show that Latex was already ahead of Goodrich in space-suit development<br/>and would therefore have no interest in stealing Goodrich secrets. The Latex suit was particularly<br/>bizarre-looking, and the Latex employee who wore it in court looked almost excruciatingly<br/>uncomfortable, as if he were unaccustomed to the air of earth, or of Akron. “His air tubes weren’t<br/>hooked up, and he was hot,” the </span></a><i>Beacon Journal </i><span>explained next day. At any rate, after he had sat<br/>suffering for ten or fifteen minutes while defense counsel questioned a witness about his costume, he<br/>suddenly pointed in an agonized way to his head, and the court record of what followed, probably<br/>unique in the annals of jurisprudence, reads like this:</span><a name="bookmark342">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span>MAN IN THE SPACE SUIT: May I take this off? (Helmet).…<br/>THE COURT: All right.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark343"><span>The second element in Goodrich’s burden of proof—that Wohlgemuth was privy to Goodrich<br/>secrets—was fairly quickly dealt with, because Wohlgemuth’s lawyers conceded that hardly anything<br/>the company knew about space suits had been kept from him; they based their defense on, first, the<br/>unquestioned fact that he had taken no papers away with him and, second, the unlikelihood that he<br/>would be able to remember the details of complex scientific processes, even if he wanted to. On the<br/>third element—the matter of irreparable injury—Jeter pointed out that Goodrich, which had made the<br/>first full-pressure flying suit in history, for the late Wiley Post’s high-altitude experiments in 1934,<br/>and which had since poured vast sums into space-suit research and development, was the<br/>unquestioned pioneer and had up to then been considered the leader in the field; he tried to paint<br/>Latex, which had been making full-pressure suits only since the mid-fifties, as a parvenu with the<br/>nefarious plan of cashing in on Goodrich’s years of research by hiring Wohlgemuth. Even if the<br/>intentions of Latex and Wohlgemuth were the best in the world, Jeter contended, Wohlgemuth would<br/>inevitably reveal Goodrich secrets in the course of working in Latex’s space-suit department. In any<br/>event, Jeter was unwilling to assume good intentions. As evidence of bad ones, there was, on the part<br/>of Latex, the fact that the firm had deliberately sought out Wohlgemuth, and, on the part of<br/>Wohlgemuth, the statement he had made to Galloway about the price of loyalty and ethics. The<br/>defense disputed the contention that a disclosure of secrets would be inevitable, and, of course,<br/>denied evil intentions on anyone’s part. It rounded out its case with a statement made in court under<br/>oath by Wohlgemuth: “I will not reveal [to International Latex] any items which in my own mind I</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>would consider to be trade secrets of the B. F. Goodrich Company.” This, of course, was cold<br/>comfort to Goodrich.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Having heard the evidence and the lawyers’ summations, Judge Harvey reserved decision until a<br/>later date and issued an order temporarily forbidding Wohlgemuth to reveal the alleged secrets or to<br/>work in the Latex space-suit program; he could go on the Latex payroll, but he had to stay out of space<br/>suits until the court’s decision was handed down. In mid-December, Wohlgemuth, leaving his family<br/>behind, went to Dover and began working for Latex on other products; early in January, by which<br/>time he had succeeded in selling his house in Wadsworth and buying one in Dover, his family joined<br/>him at his new stand.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark344"><span class="s6">IN </span></a><span>Akron, meanwhile, the lawyers had at each other in briefs intended to sway Judge Harvey. Various<br/>fine points of law were debated, learnedly but inconclusively; yet as the briefs wore on, it became<br/>increasingly clear that the essence of the case was quite simple. For all practical purposes, there was<br/>no controversy over the facts. What remained in controversy was the answers to two questions: First,<br/>should a man be formally restrained from revealing trade secrets when he has not yet committed any<br/>such act, and when it is not clear that he intends to? And, secondly, should a man be prevented from<br/>taking a job simply because the job presents him with unique temptations to break the law? Having<br/>scoured the lawbooks, counsel for the defense found exactly the text quotation they wanted in support<br/>of the argument that both questions should be answered in the negative. (Unlike the decisions of other<br/>courts, the general statements of the authors of law textbooks have no official standing in any court,<br/>but by using them judiciously an advocate can express his own opinions in someone else’s words and<br/>buttress them with bibliographical references.) The quotation was from a text entitled “Trade<br/>Secrets,” which was written by a lawyer named Ridsdale Ellis and published in 1953, and it read, in<br/>part, “Usually it is not until there is evidence that the employee [who has changed jobs] has not lived<br/>up to his contract, expressed or implied, to maintain secrecy, that the former employer can take<br/>action. In the law of torts there is the maxim: Every dog has one free bite. A dog cannot be presumed<br/>to be vicious until he has proved that he is by biting someone. As with a dog, the former employer<br/>may have to wait for a former employee to commit some overt act before he can act.” To counter this<br/>doctrine—which, besides being picturesque, appeared to have a crushingly exact applicability to the<br/>case under dispute—Goodrich’s lawyers came up with a quotation of their own from the very same<br/>book. (“Ellis on trade secrets,” as the lawyers referred to it in their briefs, was repeatedly used by<br/>the two sides to belabor each other, for the good reason that it was the only text on the subject<br/>available in the Summit County law library, where both sides did the bulk of their research.) In<br/>support of </span><i>their </i><span>cause, Goodrich counsel found that Ellis had said, in connection with trade-secrets<br/>cases in which the defendant was a company accused of luring away another company’s confidential<br/>employee: “Where the confidential employee left to enter defendant’s employment, an inference can<br/>be drawn to supplement other circumstantial evidence that the latter employment was stimulated by a<br/>desireby the defendant to learn plaintiff’s secrets.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark345"><span>In other words, Ellis apparently felt that when the circumstances look suspicious, one free bite is<br/></span></a><i>not </i><span>permitted. Whether he contradicted himself or merely refined his position is a nice question; Ellis<br/>himself had died several years earlier, so it was not possible to consult him on the matter.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On February 20th, 1963, having studied the briefs and deliberated on them, Judge Harvey<br/>delivered his decision, in the form of a nine-page essay fraught with suspense. To begin with, the<br/>Judge wrote, he was convinced that Goodrich did have trade secrets relative to space suits, and that<br/>Wohlgemuth might be able to remember and therefore be able to disclose some of them to Latex, to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>the irreparable injury of Goodrich. He declared, further, that “there isn’t any doubt that the Latex<br/>company was attempting to gain [Wohlgemuth’s] valuable experience in this particular specialized<br/>field for the reason that they had this so-called ‘Apollo’ contract with the government, and there isn’t<br/>any doubt that if he is permitted to work in the space-suit division of the Latex company … he would<br/>have an opportunity to disclose confidential information of the B. F. Goodrich Company.” Still<br/>further, Judge Harvey was convinced by the attitude of Latex, as this was evidenced by the conduct of<br/>its representatives in court, that the company intended to try to get Wohlgemuth to give it “the benefit<br/>of every kind of information he had.” At this point in the opinion, things certainly looked black for the<br/>defense. However—and the Judge was well down page 6 before he got to the “however”—what he<br/>had concluded after studying the one-free-bite controversy among the lawyers was that an injunction<br/>cannot be issued against disclosure of trade secrets before such disclosure has occurred unless there<br/>is clear and substantial evidence of evil intent on the part of the defendant. The defendant in this case,<br/>the Judge pointed out, was Wohlgemuth, and if any evil intent was involved, it appeared to be<br/>attributableto Latex rather than to him. For this reason, along with some technical ones, he wound up,<br/>“It is the view and the Order of this Court that Injunction be denied against the defendant.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark346"><span>Goodrich promptly appealed the decision, and the Summit County Court of Appeals, pending its<br/>own decision on the case, issued another restraining order, which differed from Judge Harvey’s in<br/>that it permitted Wohlgemuth to do space-suit work for Latex, but still forbade him to disclose<br/>Goodrich’s alleged trade secrets. Accordingly, Wohlgemuth, with an initial victory under his belt but<br/>with a new legal struggle on his behalf ahead, went to work in the Latex moon-suit shop.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Jeter and his colleagues, in their brief to the Court of Appeals, stated unequivocally that Judge<br/>Harvey had been wrong not only in some of the technical aspects of his decision but in his finding that<br/>there must be evidence of bad faith on the defendant’s part before an injunction can be granted. “The<br/>question to be decided is not one of good or bad faith, but, rather, whether there is a threat or a<br/>likelihood that trade secrets will be disclosed,” the Goodrich brief declared roundly—and a little<br/>inconsistently, in view of all the time and effort the company had expended on attempts to pin bad<br/>faith on both Latex and Wohlgemuth. Wohlgemuth’s lawyers, of course, did not fail to point out the<br/>inconsistency. “It seems strange indeed that Goodrich should find fault with this finding of Judge<br/>Harvey,” they remarked in their brief. Quite clearly, they had conceived for Judge Harvey feelings so<br/>tender as to border on the protective.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The decision of the Court of Appeals was handed down on May 22nd. Written by Judge Arthur W.<br/>Doyle, with his two colleagues of the court concurring, it was a partial reversal of Judge Harvey.<br/>Finding that “there exists a present real threat of disclosure, even without actual disclosure,” and that<br/>“an injunction may … prevent a future wrong,” the court granted an injunction that restrained<br/>Wohlgemuth from disclosing to Latex any of the processes and information claimed as trade secrets<br/>by Goodrich. On the other hand, Judge Doyle wrote, “We have no doubt that Wohlgemuth had the<br/>right to take employment in a competitive business, and to use his knowledge (other than trade<br/>secrets) and experience for the benefit of his new employer.” Plainly put, Wohlgemuth was at last<br/>free to accept a permanent job doing space-suit work for Latex, provided only that he refrained from<br/>disclosing Goodrich secrets in the course of his work.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NEITHER <span class="p">side carried the case above the Summit County Court of Appeals—to the Ohio Supreme<br/>Court and, beyond that, to the United States Supreme Court—so with the decision of the Appeals<br/>Court the Wohlgemuth case was settled. Public interest in it subsided soon after the trial was over,<br/>but professional interest continued to mount, and, of course, it mounted still more after the Appeals</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark347"><span>Court decision in May. In March, the New York City Bar Association, in collaboration with the<br/>American Bar Association, had presented a symposium on trade secrets, with the Wohlgemuth case as<br/>its focus. In the later months of that year, employers worried about loss of trade secrets brought<br/>numerous suits against former employees, presumably relying on the Wohlgemuth decision as a<br/>precedent. A year later there were more than two dozen trade-secrets cases pending in the courts, the<br/>most publicized of them being the effort of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. to prevent one of its<br/>former research engineers from taking part in the production of certain rare pigments for the American<br/>Potash &amp; Chemical Corporation.</span></a><a name="bookmark348">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It would be logical to suppose that Jeter might be worried about enforcement of the Appeals<br/>Court’s order—might be afraid that Wohlgemuth, working behind the locked door of the Latex<br/>laboratory, and perhaps nursing a grudge against Goodrich, would take his one free bite in spite of the<br/>order, on the assumption that he would not be caught. However, Jeter didn’t look at things that way.<br/>“Until and unless we learn otherwise, we assume that Wohlgemuth and International Latex, both<br/>having knowledge of the court order, will comply with the law,” Jeter said after the case was<br/>concluded. “No specific steps by Goodrich to police the enforcement of the order have been taken, or<br/>are contemplated. However, it if should be violated, there are various ways in which we would be<br/>likely to find out. Wohlgemuth, after all, is working with others, who come and go. Out of perhaps<br/>twenty-five employees in constant touch with him, it’s likely that one or two will leave Latex within a<br/>couple of years. Furthermore, you can learn quite a lot from suppliers who deal with both Latex and<br/>Goodrich; and also from customers. However, I do not feel that the order will be violated.<br/>Wohlgemuth has been through a lawsuit. It was quite an experience for him. He now knows his<br/>responsibilities under the law, which he may not have known before.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>Wohlgemuth himself said late in 1963 that since the conclusion of the case he had received a great<br/>many inquiries from other scientists working in industry, the gist of their questions being, “Does your<br/>case mean that I’m married to my job?” He told them that they would have to draw their own<br/>conclusions. Wohlgemuth also said that the court order had had no effect on his work in the Latex<br/>space-suit department. “Precisely what the Goodrich secrets are is not spelled out in the order, and<br/>therefore I have acted as if all the things they alleged to be secrets actually </span><i>are </i><span>secrets,” he said.<br/>“Nevertheless, my efficiency is not impaired by my avoiding disclosure of those things. Take, for<br/>example, the use of polyurethane as an inner liner—a process that Goodrich claimed as a trade secret.<br/>That was something Latex had tried previously and found unsatisfactory. Therefore, it wasn’t planning<br/>to investigate further along those lines, and it still isn’t, I am just as effective for Latex as if there had<br/>never been an injunction. However, I will say this. If I were to get a better offer from some other<br/>company now, I’m sure I would evaluate the question very carefully—which is what I didn’t do the<br/>last time.” Wohlgemuth—the new, post-trial Wohlgemuth—spoke in a noticeably slow, tense way,<br/>with long pauses for thought, as if the wrong word might bring lightning down on his head. He was a<br/>young man with a strong sense of belonging to the future, and he looked forward to making, if he<br/>could, a material contribution to putting man on the moon. At the same time, Jeter may have been<br/>right; he was also a man who had recently spent almost six months in the toils of the law, and who<br/>worked, and would continue to work, in the knowledge that a slip of the tongue might mean a fine,<br/>imprisonment, and professional ruin.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark349">12</a><a name="bookmark350">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark351">In Defense of Sterling</a><a name="bookmark352">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark353">THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK </a><span class="p">of New York stands on the block bounded by Liberty, Nassau, and<br/>William Streets and Maiden Lane, on the slope of one of the few noticeable hillocks remaining in the<br/>bulldozed, skyscraper-flattened earth of downtown Manhattan. Its entrance faces Liberty, and its mien<br/>is dignified and grim. Its arched ground-floor windows, designed in imitation of those of the Pitti and<br/>Riccardi Palaces in Florence, are protected by iron grilles made of bars as thick as a boy’s wrist, and<br/>above them are rows of small rectangular windows set in a blufflike fourteen-story wall of sandstone<br/>and limestone, the blocks of which once varied in color from brown through gray to blue, but which<br/>soot has reduced to a common gray; the façade’s austerity is relieved only at the level of the twelfth<br/>floor, by a Florentine loggia. Two giant iron lanterns—near-replicas of lanterns that adorn the Strozzi<br/>Palace in Florence—flank the main entrance, but they seem to be there less to please or illuminate the<br/>entrant than to intimidate him. Nor is the building’s interior much more cheery or hospitable; the<br/>ground floor features cavernous groin vaulting and high ironwork partitions in intricate geometric,<br/>floral, and animal designs, and it is guarded by hordes of bank security men, whose dark-blue<br/>uniforms make them look much like policemen.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span>Huge and dour as it is, the Federal Reserve Bank, as a building, arouses varied feelings in its<br/>beholders. To admirers of the debonair new Chase Manhattan Bank across Liberty Street, which is<br/>notable for huge windows, bright-colored tiled walls, and stylish Abstract Expressionist paintings, it<br/>is an epitome of nineteenth-century heavy-footedness in bank architecture, even though it was actually<br/>completed in 1924. To an awestruck writer for the magazine </span><i>Architecture </i><span>in 1927, it seemed “as<br/>inviolable as the Rock of Gibraltar and no less inspiring of one’s reverent obeisance,” and possessed<br/>of “a quality which, for lack of a better word, I can best describe as ‘epic’” To the mothers of young<br/>girls who work in it as secretaries or pages, it looks like a particularly sinister sort of prison. Bank<br/>robbers are apparently equally respectful of its inviolability; there has never been the slightest hint of<br/>an attempt on it. To the Municipal Art Society of New York, which now rates it as a full-fledged<br/>landmark, it was until 1967 only a second-class landmark, being assigned to Category II, “Structures<br/>of Great Local or Regional Importance Which Should Be Preserved,” rather than Category I,<br/>“Structures of National Importance Which Should Be Preserved at All Costs.” On the other hand, it<br/>has one indisputable edge on the Pitti, Riccardi, and Strozzi Palaces: It is bigger than any of them. In<br/>fact, it is a bigger Florentine palace than has ever stood in Florence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is set apart from the other banks of Wall Street in purpose</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>and function as well as in appearance. As by far the largest and most important of the twelve regional<br/>Federal Reserve Banks—which, together with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and the<br/>sixty-two hundred commercial banks that are members, make up the Federal Reserve System—it is<br/>the chief operating arm of the United States’ central-banking institution. Most other countries have<br/>only one central bank—the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and so on—rather than a network of<br/>such banks, but the central banks of all countries have the same dual purpose: to keep the national<br/>currency in a healthy state by regulating its supply, partly through the degree of ease or difficulty with<br/>which it may be borrowed, and, when necessary, to defend its value in relation to that of other<br/>national currencies. To accomplish the first objective, the New York bank coöperates with its parent<br/>board and its eleven brother banks in periodically adjusting a number of monetary throttles, of which<br/>the most visible (although not necessarily the most important) is the rate of interest at which it lends<br/>money to other banks. As to the second objective, by virtue of tradition and of its situation in the<br/>nation’s and the world’s greatest financial center, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the sole<br/>agent of the Federal Reserve System and of the United States Treasury in dealings with other<br/>countries. Thus, on its shoulders falls the chief responsibility for operations in defense of the dollar.<br/>Those responsibilities were weighing heavily during the great monetary crisis of 1968—and, indeed,<br/>since the defense of the dollar sometimes involves the defense of other currencies as well, over the<br/>preceding three and a half years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark354"><span>Charged as it is with acting in the national interest—in fact having no other purpose—the Federal<br/>Reserve Bank of New York, together with its brother banks, obviously is an arm of government. Yet<br/>it has a foot in the free-enterprise camp; in what some might call characteristic American fashion, it<br/>stands squarely astride the chalk line between government and business. Although it functions as a<br/>government agency, its stock is privately owned by the member banks throughout the country, to<br/>which it pays annual dividends limited by law to six per cent per year. Although its top officers take a<br/>federal oath, they are not appointed by the President of the United States, or even by the Federal<br/>Reserve Board, but are elected by the bank’s own board of directors, and their salaries are paid not<br/>out of the federal till but out of the bank’s own income. Yet that income—though, happily, always<br/>forthcoming—is entirely incidental to the bank’s purpose, and if it rises above expenses and<br/>dividends the excess is automatically paid into the United States Treasury. A bank that considers<br/>profits incidental is scarcely the norm in Wall Street, and this attitude puts Federal Reserve Bank men<br/>in a uniquely advantageous social position. Because their bank </span></a><i>is </i><span>a bank, after all, and a privately<br/>owned, profitable one at that, they can’t be dismissed as mere government bureaucrats; conversely,<br/>having their gaze fixed steadily above the mire of cupidity entitles them to be called the intellectuals,<br/>if not actually the aristocrats, of Wall Street banking.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark355"><span>Under them lies gold—still the bedrock on which all money nominally rests, though in recent times<br/>a bedrock that has been shuddering ominously under the force of various monetary earthquakes. As of<br/>March, 1968, more than thirteen thousand tons of the stuff, worth more than thirteen billion dollars<br/>and amounting to more than a quarter of all the monetary gold in the free world, reposed on actual<br/>bedrock seventy-six feet below the Liberty Street level and fifty below sea level, in a vault that<br/>would be inundated if a system of sump pumps did not divert a stream that originally wandered<br/>through Maiden Lane. The famous nineteenth-century British economist Walter Bagehot once told a<br/>friend that when his spirits were low it used to cheer him to go down to his bank and “dabble my<br/>hand in a heap of sovereigns.” Although it is, to say the least, a stimulating experience to go down and<br/></span></a><i>look </i><span>at the gold in the Federal Reserve Bank vault, which is in the form not of sovereigns but of dully<br/>gleaming bars about the size and shape of building bricks, not even the best-accredited visitor is</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>allowed to dabble his hands in it; for one thing, the bars weigh about twenty-eight pounds each and<br/>are therefore ill-adapted to dabbling, and, for another, none of the gold belongs to either the Federal<br/>Reserve Bank or the United States. All United States gold is kept at Fort Knox, at the New York<br/>Assay Office, or at the various mints; the gold deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank belongs to some<br/>seventy other countries—the largest depositors being European—which find it convenient to store a<br/>good part of their gold reserves there. Originally, most of them put gold there for safekeeping during<br/>the Second World War. After the war, the European nations—with the exception of France—not only<br/>left it in New York but greatly increased its quantity as their economies recovered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Nor does the gold represent anything like all the foreign deposits at Liberty Street; investments of<br/>various sorts brought the March ’68 total to more than twenty-eight billion. As a banker for most of<br/>the central banks of the non-Communist world, and as the central bank representing the world’s<br/>leading currency, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the undisputed chief citadel of world<br/>currency. By virtue of this position, it is afforded a kind of fluoroscopic vision of the insides of<br/>international finance, enabling it to detect at a glance an incipiently diseased currency here, a faltering<br/>economy there. If, for example, Great Britain is running a deficit in her foreign dealings, this instantly<br/>shows up in the Federal Reserve Bank’s books in the form of a decline in the Bank of England’s<br/>balance. In the fall of 1964, precisely such a decline was occurring, and it marked the beginning of a<br/>long, gallant, intermittently hair-raising, and ultimately losing struggle by a number of countries and<br/>their central banks, led by the United States and the Federal Reserve, to safeguard the existing order<br/>of world finance by preserving the integrity of the pound sterling. One trouble with imposing<br/>buildings is that they have a tendency to belittle the people and activities they enclose, and most of the<br/>time it is reasonably accurate to think of the Federal Reserve Bank as a place where often bored<br/>people push around workaday slips of paper quite similar to those pushed around in other banks. But<br/>since 1964  some of the events there,  if they have scarcely been capable of inspiring reverent<br/>obeisance, have had a certain epic quality.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark356">EARLY </a><span class="p">in 1964, it began to be clear that Britain, which for several years had maintained an<br/>approximate equilibrium in her international balance of payments—that is, the amount of money she<br/>had annually sent outside her borders had been about equal to the amount she had taken in—was<br/>running a substantial deficit. Far from being the result of domestic depression in Britain, this situation<br/>was the result of overexuberant domestic expansion; business was booming, and newly affluent<br/>Britons were ordering bales and bales of costly goods from abroad without increasing the exports of<br/>British goods on anything like the same scale. In short, Britain was living beyond her means. A<br/>substantial balance-of-payments deficit is a worry to a relatively self-sufficient country like the<br/>United States (indeed, the United States was having that very worry at that very time, and it would for<br/>years to come), but to a trading nation like Britain, about a quarter of whose entire economy is<br/>dependent on foreign trade, it constitutes a grave danger.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The situation was cause for growing concern at the Federal Reserve Bank, and the focal point of<br/>the concern was the office, on the tenth floor, of Charles A. Coombs, the bank’s vice-president in<br/>charge  of foreign operations. All summer long, the fluoroscope showed a sick and worsening pound<br/>sterling. From the research section of the foreign department, Coombs daily got reports that a torrent<br/>of money was leaving Britain. From underground, word rose that the pile of gold bars in the locker<br/>assigned to Britain was shrinking appreciably—not through any foul play in the vault but because so<br/>many of the bars were being transferred to other lockers in settlement of Britain’s international debts.<br/>From the foreign-exchange trading desk, on the seventh floor, the news almost every afternoon was</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>that the open-market quotations on the pound in terms of dollars had sunk again that day. During July<br/>and August, as the quotation dropped from $2.79 to $2.7890, and then to $2.7875, the situation was<br/>regarded on Liberty Street as so serious that Coombs, who would normally handle foreign-exchange<br/>matters himself, only making routine reports to those higher up, was constantly conferring about it<br/>with his boss, the Federal Reserve Bank’s president, a tall, cool, soft-spoken man named Alfred<br/>Hayes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark357"><span>Mystifyingly complex though it may appear, what  actually happens in international financial<br/>dealings is essentially what happens in private domestic transactions. The money worries of a nation,<br/>like those of a family, are the consequence of having too much money go out and not enough come in.<br/>The foreign sellers of goods to Britain cannot spend the pounds they are paid in their own countries,<br/>and therefore they convert them into their own currencies; this they do by selling the pounds in the<br/>foreign-exchange markets, just as if they were selling securities on a stock exchange. The market<br/>price of the pound fluctuates in response to supply and demand, and so do the prices of all other<br/>currencies—all, that is, except the dollar, the sun in the planetary system of currencies, inasmuch as<br/>the United States has, since 1934, stood pledged to exchange gold in any quantity for dollars at the<br/>pleasure of any nation at the fixed price of thirty-five dollars per ounce.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark358"><span>Under the pressure of selling, the price of the pound goes down. But its fluctuations are severely<br/>restricted. The influence of market forces cannot be allowed to lower or raise the price more than a<br/>couple of cents below or above the pound’s par value; if such wild swings should occur unchecked,<br/>bankers and businessmen everywhere who traded with Britain would find themselves involuntarily<br/>engaged in a kind of roulette game, and would be inclined to stop trading with Britain. Accordingly,<br/>under international monetary rules agreed upon at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, and<br/>elaborated at various other places at later times, the pound in 1964, nominally valued at $2.80, was<br/>allowed to fluctuate only between $2.78 and $2.82, and the enforcer of this abridgment of the law of<br/>supply and demand was the Bank of England. On a day when things were going smoothly, the pound<br/>might be quoted on the exchange markets at, say, $2.7990, a rise of $.0015 from the previous day’s<br/>closing. (Fifteen-hundredths of a cent doesn’t sound like much, but on a round million dollars, which<br/>is generally the basic unit in international monetary dealings, it amounts to fifteen hundred dollars.)<br/>When that happened, the Bank of England needed to do nothing. If, however, the pound was strong in<br/>the markets and rose to $2.82 (something it showed absolutely no tendency to do in 1964), the Bank<br/>of England was pledged to—and would have been very happy to—accept gold or dollars in exchange<br/>for pounds at that price, thereby preventing a further increase in the price and at the same time<br/>increasing its own reserve of gold and dollars, which serve as the pound’s backing. If, on the other<br/>hand (and this was a more realistic hypothesis), the pound was weak and sank to $2.78, the Bank of<br/>England’s sworn duty was to intervene in the market and buy with gold or dollars all pounds offered<br/>for sale at that price, however deeply this might have cut into its own reserves. Thus, the central bank<br/>of a spendthrift country, like the father of a spendthrift family, is eventually forced to pay the bills out<br/>of capital. But in times of serious currency weakness the central bank loses even more of its reserves<br/>than this would suggest, because of the vagaries of market psychology. Prudent importers and<br/>exporters seeking to protect their capital and profits reduce to a minimum the sum they hold in pounds<br/>and the length of time they hold it. Currency speculators, whose noses have been trained to sniff out<br/>weakness, pounce on a falling pound and make enormous short sales, in the expectation of turning a<br/>profit on a further drop, and the Bank of England must absorb the speculative sales along with the<br/>straightforward ones.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The ultimate consequence of unchecked currency weakness is something that may be incomparably</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>more disastrous in its effects than family bankruptcy. This is devaluation, and devaluation of a key<br/>world currency like the pound is the recurrent nightmare of all central bankers, whether in London,<br/>New York, Frankfurt, Zurich, or Tokyo. If at any time the drain on Britain’s reserves became so great<br/>that the Bank of England was unable, or unwilling, to fulfill its obligation to maintain the pound at</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark359"><span>$2.78, the necessary result would be devaluation. That is, the $2.78-to-$2.82 limitation would be<br/>abruptly abrogated; by simple government decree the par value of the pound would be reduced to<br/>some lower figure, and a new set of limits established around the new parity. The heart of the danger<br/>was the possibility that what followed might be chaos not confined to Britain. Devaluation, as the<br/>most heroic and most dangerous of remedies for a sick currency, is rightly feared. By making the<br/>devaluing country’s goods cheaper to others, it boosts exports, and thus reduces or eliminates a<br/>deficit in international accounts, but at the same time it makes both imports and domestic goods more<br/>expensive at home, and thus reduces the country’s standard of living. It is radical surgery, curing a<br/>disease at the expense of some of the patient’s strength and well-being—and, in many cases, some of<br/>his pride and prestige as well. Worst of all, if the devalued currency is one that, like the pound, is<br/>widely used in international dealings, the disease—or, more precisely, the cure—is likely to prove<br/>contagious. To nations holding large amounts of that particular currency in their reserve vaults, the<br/>effects of the devaluation is the same as if the vaults had been burglarized. Such nations and others,<br/>finding themselves at an unacceptable trading disadvantage as a result of the devaluation, may have to<br/>resort to competitive devaluation of their own currencies. A downward spiral develops: Rumors of<br/>further devaluations are constantly in the wind; the loss of confidence in other people’s money leads<br/>to a disinclination to do business across national borders; and international trade, upon which depend<br/>the food and shelter of hundreds of millions of people around the world, tends to decline. Just such a<br/>disaster followed the classic devaluation of all time, the departure of the pound from the old gold<br/>standard in 1931—an event that is still generally considered a major cause of the worldwide<br/>Depression of the thirties.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark360"><span>The process works similarly in respect to the currencies of all the hundred-odd countries that are<br/>members of the International Monetary Fund, an organization that originated at Bretton Woods. For<br/>any country, a favorable balance of payments means an accumulation of dollars, either directly or<br/>indirectly,  which are freely convertible into gold, in the country’s central bank; if the demand for its<br/>currency is great enough, the country may revalue it upward—the reverse of a devaluation—as both<br/>Germany and the Netherlands did in 1961. Conversely, an unfavorable balance of payments starts the<br/>sequence of events that may end in forced devaluation. The degree of disruption of world trade that<br/>devaluation of a currency causes depends on that currency’s  international importance. (A large<br/>devaluation of the Indian rupee in June, 1966, although it was a serious matter to India, created<br/>scarcely a ripple in the international markets.) And—to round out this brief outline of the rules of an<br/>intricate game of which everybody everywhere is an inadvertent player—even the lordly dollar is far<br/>from immune to the effects of an unfavorable balance of payments or of speculation. Because of the<br/>dollar’s pledged relation to gold, it serves as the standard for all other currencies, so its price does,<br/>not fluctuate in the markets. However, it can suffer weakness of a less visible but equally ominous<br/>sort. When the United States sends out substantially more money (whether payment for imports,<br/>foreign aid, investments, loans, tourist expenses, or military costs) than it takes in, the recipients<br/>freely buy their own currencies with the newly acquired dollars, thereby raising the dollar prices of<br/>their own currencies; the rise in price enables their central banks to take in still more dollars, which<br/>they can sell back to the United States for gold. Thus, when the dollar is weak the United States loses<br/>gold. France alone—a country with a strong currency and no particular official love of the dollar—</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>required thirty million dollars or more in United States gold regularly every month for several years<br/>prior to the autumn of 1966, and between 1958, when the United States began running a serious deficit<br/>in its international accounts, and the middle of March 1968, our gold reserve was halved—from<br/>twenty-two billion eight hundred million to eleven billion four hundred million dollars. If the reserve<br/>ever dropped to an unacceptably low level, the United States would be forced to break its word and<br/>lower the gold value of the dollar, or even to stop selling gold entirely. Either action would in effect<br/>be a devaluation—the one devaluation, because of the dollar’s preeminent position, that would be<br/>more disruptive to world monetary order than a devaluation of the pound.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark361">HAYES </a><span class="p">and Coombs, neither of whom is old enough to have experienced the events of 1931 at first<br/>hand as a banker but both of whom are such diligent and sensitive students of international banking<br/>that they might as well have done so, found that as the hot days of 1964 dragged on they had occasion<br/>to be in almost daily contact by transatlantic telephone with their Bank of England counterparts—the<br/>Earl of Cromer, governor of the bank at that time, and Roy A. O. Bridge, the governor’s adviser on<br/>foreign exchange. It became clear to them from these conversations and from other sources that the<br/>imbalance in Britain’s international accounts was far from the whole trouble. A crisis of confidence<br/>in the soundness of the pound was developing, and the main cause of it seemed to be the election that<br/>Britain’s Conservative Government was facing on October 15th. The one thing that international<br/>financial markets hate and fear above all others is uncertainty. Any election represents uncertainty, so<br/>the pound always has the jitters just before Britons go to the polls, but to the people who deal in<br/>currencies this election looked particularly menacing, because of their estimate of the character of the<br/>Labour Government that might come into power. The conservative financiers of London, not to<br/>mention those of Continental Europe, looked with almost irrational suspicion on Harold Wilson, the<br/>Labour choice for Prime Minister; further, some of Mr. Wilson’s economic advisers had explicitly<br/>extolled the virtues of devaluation of the pound in their earlier theoretical writings; and, finally, there<br/>was an all too pat analogy to be drawn from the fact that the last previous term of the British Labour<br/>Party in power had been conspicuously marked, in 1949, by a devaluation of sterling from the rate of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$4.03 to $2.80.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark362"><span>In these circumstances, almost all the dealers in the world money markets, whether they were<br/>ordinary international businessmen or out-and-out currency speculators, were anxious to get rid of<br/>pounds—at least until after the election. Like all speculative attacks, this one fed on itself. Each small<br/>drop in the pound’s price resulted in further loss of confidence, and down, down went the pound in<br/>the international markets—an oddly diffused sort of exchange, which does not operate in any central<br/>building but, rather, is conducted by telephone and cable between the trading desks of banks in the<br/>world’s major cities. Simultaneously, down, down went British reserves, as the Bank of England<br/>struggled to support the pound. Early in September, Hayes went to Tokyo for the annual meeting of the<br/>members of the International Monetary Fund. In the corridors of the building where participants in the<br/>Fund met, he heard one European central banker after another express misgivings about the state of<br/>the British economy and the outlook for the British currency. Why didn’t the British government take<br/>steps at home to check its outlay and to improve the balance of payments, they asked each other. Why<br/>didn’t it raise the Bank of England’s lending rate—the so-called bank rate—from its current five per<br/>cent, since this move would have the effect of raising British interest rates all up and down the line,<br/>and would thus serve the double purpose of damping down domestic inflation and attracting<br/>investment dollars to London from other financial centers, with the result that sterling would gain a<br/>sounder footing?</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Doubtless the Continental bankers also put such questions to the Bank of England men in Tokyo; in<br/>any event, the Bank of England men and their counterparts in the British Exchequer had not failed to<br/>put the questions to themselves. But the proposed measures would certainly be unpopular with the<br/>British electorate, as unmistakable harbingers of austerity, and the Conservative Government, like<br/>many governments before it, appeared to be paralyzed by fear of the imminent election. So it did<br/>nothing. In a strictly monetary way, however, Britain did take defensive measures during September.<br/>The Bank of England had for several years had a standing agreement with the Federal Reserve that<br/>either institution could borrow five hundred million dollars from the other, over a short term, at any<br/>time, with virtually no formalities; now the Bank of England accepted this standby loan and made<br/>arrangements to supplement it with another five hundred million dollars in short-term credit from<br/>various European central banks and the Bank of Canada. This total of a billion dollars, together with<br/>Britain’s last-ditch reserves in gold and dollars, amounting to about two billion six hundred million,<br/>constituted a sizable store of ammunition. If the speculative assault on the pound should continue or<br/>intensify, answering fire would come from the Bank of England in the form of dollar investments in<br/>sterling made on the battlefield of the free market, and presumably the attackers would be put to rout.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark363"><span>As might have been expected, the assault did intensify after Labour came out the victor in the<br/>October election. The new British government realized at the outset that it was faced with a grave<br/>crisis, and that immediate and drastic action was in order. It has since been said that summary<br/>devaluation of the pound was seriously considered by the newly elected Prime Minister and his<br/>advisers on finance—George Brown, Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, and James Callaghan,<br/>Chancellor of the Exchequer. The idea was rejected, though, and the measures they actually took, in<br/>October and early November, were a fifteen-percent emergency surcharge on British imports (in<br/>effect, a blanket raising of tariffs), an increased fuel tax, and stiff new capital-gains and corporation<br/>taxes. These were deflationary, currency-strengthening measures, to be sure, but the world markets<br/>were not reassured. The specific nature of the new taxes seems to have disconcerted, and even<br/>enraged, many financiers, in and out of Britain, particularly in view of the fact that under the new<br/>budget British government spending on welfare benefits was actually to be increased, rather than cut<br/>back, as deflationary policy would normally require. One way and another, then, the sellers—or<br/>bears, in market jargon—continued to be in charge of the market for the pound in the weeks after the<br/>election, and the Bank of England was kept busy potting away at them with precious shells from its<br/>borrowed-billion-dollar arsenal. By the end of October, nearly half the billion was gone, and the<br/>bears were still inexorably advancing on the pound, a hundredth of a cent at a time.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark364"><span>Hayes, Coombs, and their foreign-department colleagues on Liberty Street, watching with mounting<br/>anxiety, were as galled as the British by the fact that a central bank defending its currency against<br/>attack can have only the vaguest idea of where the attack is coming from. Speculation is inherent in<br/>foreign trade, and by its nature is almost impossible to isolate, identify, or even define. There are<br/>degrees of speculation; the word itself, like “selfishness” or “greed,” denotes a judgment, and yet<br/>every exchange of currencies might be called a speculation in favor of the currency being acquired<br/>and against the one being disposed of. At one end of the scale are perfectly legitimate business<br/>transactions that have specific speculative effects. A British importer ordering American merchandise<br/>may legitimately pay up in pounds in advance of delivery; if he does, he is speculating against the<br/>pound. An American importer who has contracted to pay for British goods at a price set in pounds<br/>may legitimately insist that his purchase of the pounds he needs to settle his debt be deferred for a<br/>certain period; he, too, is speculating against the pound. (The staggering importance to Britain of<br/>these common commercial operations, which are called “leads” and “lags,” respectively, is shown by</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>the fact that if in normal times the world’s buyers of British goods were all to withhold their<br/>payments for as short a period as two and a half months the Bank of England’s gold and dollar<br/>reserves would vanish.) At the other end of the scale is the dealer in money who borrows pounds and<br/>then converts the loan into dollars. Such a dealer, instead of merely protecting his business interests,<br/>is engaging in an out-and-out speculative move called a short sale; hoping to buy back the pounds he<br/>owes more cheaply later on, he is simply trying to make a profit on the decrease in value he<br/>anticipates—and, what with the low commissions prevailing in the international money market, the<br/>maneuver provides one of the world’s most attractive forms of high-stakes gambling.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark365"><span>Gambling of this sort, although in fact it probably contributed far less to the sterling crisis than the<br/>self-protective measures taken by nervous importers and exporters, was being widely blamed for all<br/>the pound’s troubles of October and November, 1964. Particularly in the British Parliament, there<br/>were angry references to speculative activity by “the gnomes of Zurich”—Zurich being singled out<br/>because Switzerland, whose banking laws rigidly protect the anonymity of depositors, is the blind pig<br/>of international banking, and consequently much currency speculation, originating in many parts of the<br/>world, is funnelled through Zurich. Besides low commissions and anonymity, currency speculation<br/>has another attraction. Thanks to time differentials and good telephone service, the world money<br/>market, unlike stock exchanges, race tracks, and gambling casinos, practically never closes. London<br/>opens an hour after the Continent (or did until February 1968, when Britain adopted Continental<br/>time), New York five (now six) hours after that, San Francisco three hours after </span></a><i>that</i><span>, and then Tokyo<br/>gets under way about the time San Francisco closes. Only a need for sleep or a lack of money need<br/>halt the operations of a really hopelessly addicted plunger anywhere.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“It was <i>not </i><span>the gnomes of Zurich who were beating down the pound,” a leading Zurich banker<br/>subsequently maintained—stopping short of claiming that there were no gnomes there. Nonetheless,<br/>organized short selling—what traders call a bear raid—was certainly in progress, and the defenders<br/>of the pound in London and their sympathizers in New York would have given plenty to catch a<br/>glimpse of the invisible enemy.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IT <span class="p">was in this atmosphere, then, that on the weekend beginning November 7th the leading central<br/>bankers of the world held their regular monthly gathering in Basel, Switzerland. The occasion for<br/>such gatherings, which have been held regularly since the nineteen-thirties except during the Second<br/>World War, is the monthly meeting of the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements,<br/>which was established in Basel in 1930 primarily as a clearing house for the handling of reparations<br/>payments arising out of the First World War but has come to serve as an agency of international<br/>monetary coöperation and, incidentally, a kind of central bankers’ club. As such, it is considerably<br/>more limited in resources and restricted as to membership than the International Monetary Fund, but,<br/>like other exclusive clubs, it is often the scene of great decisions. Represented on its board of<br/>directors are Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and<br/>Switzerland—in short, the economic powers of Western Europe—while the United States is a regular<br/>monthly guest whose presence is counted on, and Canada and Japan are less frequent visitors. The<br/>Federal Reserve is almost always represented by Coombs, and sometimes by Hayes and other New<br/>York officers as well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark366"><span>In the nature of things, the interests of the different central banks conflict; their faces are set against<br/>each other almost as if they were players in a poker game. Even so, in view of the fact that<br/>international troubles with money at their root have almost as long a history as similarly caused<br/>troubles between individuals, the most surprising thing about international monetary coöperation is</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>that it is so new. Through all the ages prior to the First World War, it cannot be said to have existed<br/>at all. In the nineteen-twenties, it existed chiefly through close personal ties between individual<br/>central bankers, often maintained in spite of the indifference of their governments. On an official<br/>level, it got off to a halting start through the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, which was<br/>supposed to encourage joint action to prevent monetary catastrophes. The sterling collapse of 1931<br/>and its grim sequel were ample proof of the committee’s failure. But better days were ahead. The<br/>1944 international financial conference at Bretton Woods—out of which emerged not only the<br/>International Monetary Fund but also the whole structure of postwar monetary rules designed to help<br/>establish and maintain fixed exchange rates, as well as the World Bank, designed to ease the flow of<br/>money from rich countries to poor or war-devastated ones—stands as a milestone in economic<br/>coöperation comparable to the formation of the United Nations in political affairs. To cite just one of<br/>the conference’s fruits, a credit of more than a billion dollars extended to Britain by the International<br/>Monetary Fund during the Suez affair in 1956 prevented a major international financial crisis then.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark367"><span>In subsequent years, economic changes, like other changes, tended to come more and more quickly;<br/>after 1958, monetary crises began springing up virtually overnight, and the International Monetary<br/>Fund, which is hindered by slow-moving machinery, sometimes proved inadequate to meet such<br/>crises alone. Again the new spirit of coöperation rose to the occasion, this time with the richest of<br/>nations, the United States, taking the lead. Starting in 1961, the Federal Reserve Bank, with the<br/>approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury in Washington, joined the other leading<br/>central banks in setting up a system of ever-ready revolving credits, which soon came to be called the<br/>“swap network.” The purpose of the network was to complement the International Monetary Fund’s<br/>longer-term credit facilities by giving central banks instant access to funds they might need for a short<br/>period in order to move fast and vigorously in defense of their currencies. Its effectiveness was not<br/>long in being put to the test. Between its initiation in 1961 and the autumn of 1964, the swap network<br/>had played a major part in the triumphant defense against sudden and violent speculative attacks on at<br/>least three currencies: the pound, late in 1961; the Canadian dollar, in June, 1961; and the Italian lira,<br/>in March, 1964. By the autumn of 1964, the swap agreements (</span></a><i>“L’accord de swap” </i><span>to the French,<br/></span><i>“die Swap-Verpflichtungen” </i><span>to the Germans) had come to be the very cornerstone of international<br/>monetary coöperation. Indeed, the five hundred million American dollars that the Bank of England<br/>was finding it necessary to draw on at the very moment the bank’s top officers were heading for Basel<br/>that November weekend represented part of the swap network, greatly expanded from its<br/>comparatively modest beginnings.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark368"><span>As for the Bank for International Settlements, in its capacity as a banking institution it was a<br/>relatively minor cog in all this machinery, but in its capacity as a club it had over the years come to<br/>play a far from unimportant role. Its monthly board meetings served (and still serve) as a chance for<br/>the central bankers to talk in an informal atmosphere—to exchange gossip, views, and hunches such<br/>as could not comfortably be indulged in either by mail or over the international telephone circuits.<br/>Basel, a medieval Rhenish city that is dominated by the spires of its twelfth-century Gothic cathedral<br/>and has long been a thriving center of the chemical industry, was originally chosen as the site of the<br/>Bank for International Settlements because it was a nodal point for European railways. Now that most<br/>international bankers habitually travel by plane, that asset has become a liability, for there is no long-<br/>distance air service to Basel; delegates must deplane at Zurich and continue by train or car. On the<br/>other hand, Basel has several first-rate restaurants, and it may be that in the view of the central-bank<br/>delegates this advantage outweighs the travel inconvenience, for central banking—or at least<br/>European central banking—has a firmly established association with good living. A governor of the</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>National Bank of Belgium once remarked to a visitor, without a smile, that he considered one of his<br/>duties to be that of leaving the institution’s wine cellar better than he had found it. A luncheon guest at<br/>the Bank of France is generally told apologetically, “In the tradition of the bank, we serve only simple<br/>fare,” but what follows is a repast during which the constant discussion of vintages makes any<br/>discussion of banking awkward, if not impossible, and at which the tradition of simplicity is honored,<br/>apparently, by the serving of only one wine before the cognac. The table of the Bank of Italy is<br/>equally elegant (some say the best in Rome), and its surroundings are enhanced by the priceless<br/>Renaissance paintings, acquired as defaulted security on bad loans over the years, that hang on the<br/>walls. As for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, alcohol in any form is hardly ever served<br/>there, banking is habitually discussed at meals, and the  mistress of the  kitchen appears almost<br/>pathetically grateful whenever one of the officers makes any sort of comment, even a critical one, on<br/>the fare. But then Liberty Street isn’t Europe.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark369"><span>In these democratic times, central banking in Europe is thought of as the last stronghold of the<br/>aristocratic banking tradition, in which wit, grace, and culture coexist easily with commercial<br/>astuteness, and even ruthlessness. The European counterparts of the security guards on Liberty Street<br/>are apt to be attendants in morning coats. Until less than a generation ago, formality of address<br/>between central bankers was the rule. Some think that the first to break it were the British, during the<br/>Second World War, when, it is alleged, a secret order went out that British government and military<br/>authorities were to address their American counterparts by their first names; in any event, first names<br/>are frequently exchanged between European and American central bankers now, and one reason for<br/>this, unquestionably, is the postwar rise in influence of the dollar. (Another reason is that, in the<br/>emerging era of coöperation, the central bankers see more of each other than they used to—not just in<br/>Basel but in Washington, Paris, and Brussels, at regular meetings of perhaps half a dozen special<br/>banking committees of various international organizations. The same handful of top bankers parades<br/>so regularly through the hotel lobbies of those cities that one of them thinks they must give the<br/>impression of being hundreds strong, like the spear carriers who cross the stage again and again in the<br/>triumphal scene of “Aida.”) And language, like the manner of its use, has tended to follow economic<br/>power. European central bankers have always used French (“bad French,” some say) in talking with<br/>each other, but during the long period in which the pound was the world’s leading currency English<br/>came to be the first language of central banking at large, and under the rule of the dollar it continues to<br/>be. It is spoken fluently and willingly by all the top officers of every central bank except the Bank of<br/>France, and even the Bank of France officers are forced to keep translators at hand, in consideration<br/>of the seeming intractable inability or unwillingness of most Britons and Americans to become<br/>competent in any language but their own. (Lord Cromer, flouting tradition, speaks French with<br/>complete authority.)</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At Basel, good food and convenience come before splendor; many of the delegates favor an<br/>outwardly humble restaurant in the main railroad station, and the Bank for International Settlements<br/>itself is modestly situated between a tea shop and a hairdressing establishment. On that November<br/>weekend in 1964, Vice-President Coombs was the only representative of the Federal Reserve System<br/>on hand, and, indeed, he was to be the key banking representative of the United States through the<br/>early and middle phases of the crisis that was then mounting. In an abstracted way, Coombs ate and<br/>drank heartily with the others—true to his institution’s traditions, he is less than a gourmet—but his<br/>real interest was in getting the sense of the meeting and the private feelings of its participants. He was<br/>the perfect man for this task, inasmuch as he has the unquestioning trust and respect of all his foreign<br/>colleagues. The other leading central bankers habitually call him by his first name—less, it seems, in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark370"><span>deference to changed custom than out of deep affection and admiration. They also use it in speaking of<br/>him among themselves; the name “Charliecoombs” (run together thus out of long habituation) is a<br/>word to conjure with in central-banking circles. Charliecoombs, they will tell you, is the kind of New<br/>Englander (he is from Newton, Massachusetts) who, although his clipped speech and dry manner<br/>make him seem a bit cool and detached, is really warm and intuitive. Charliecoombs, although a<br/>Harvard graduate (Class of 1940), is the kind of unpretentious gray-haired man with half-rimmed<br/>spectacles and a precise manner whom you might easily take for a standard American small-town<br/>bank president, rather than a master of one of the world’s most complex skills. It is generally<br/>conceded that if any one man was the genius behind the swap network, the man was the New England<br/>swapper Charliecoombs.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark371"><span>At Basel, there was, as usual, a series of formal sessions, each with its agenda, but there was also,<br/>as usual, much informal palaver in rump sessions held in hotel rooms and offices and at a formal<br/>Sunday-night dinner at which there was no agenda but instead a free discussion of what Coombs has<br/>since referred to as “the hottest topic of the moment.” There could be no question about what that<br/>was; it was the condition of the pound—and, indeed, Coombs had heard little discussion of anything<br/>else all weekend. “It was clear to me from what I heard that confidence in sterling was deteriorating,”<br/>he has said. Two questions were on most of the bankers’ minds. One was whether the Bank of<br/>England proposed to take some of the pressure off the pound by raising its lending rate. Bank of<br/>England men were present, but getting an answer was not a simple matter of asking them their<br/>intentions; even if they had been willing to say, they would not have been able to, because the Bank of<br/>England is not empowered to change its rate without the approval—which in practice often comes<br/>closer to meaning the instruction—of the British government, and elected governments have a natural<br/>dislike for measures that make money tight. The other question was whether Britain had enough gold<br/>and dollars to throw into the breach if the speculative assault should continue. Apart from what was<br/>left of the billion dollars from the expanded swap network and what remained of its drawing rights on<br/>the International Monetary Fund, Britain had only its official reserves, which had dropped in the<br/>previous week to something under two and a half billion dollars—their lowest point in several years.<br/>Worse than that was the frightful rate at which the reserves were dwindling away; on a single bad day<br/>during the previous week, according to the guesses of experts, they had dropped by eighty-seven<br/>million dollars. A month of days like that and they would be gone.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Even so, Coombs has said, nobody at Basel that weekend dreamed that the pressure on sterling<br/>could become as intense as it actually did become later in the month. He returned to New York<br/>worried but resolute. It was not to New York, however, that the main scene of the battle for sterling<br/>shifted after the Basel meeting; it was to London. The big immediate question was whether or not<br/>Britain would raise its bank rate that week, and the day the answer would be known was Thursday,<br/>November 12th. In the matter of the bank rate, as in so many other things, the British customarily<br/>follow a ritual. If there is to be a change, at noon on Thursday—then and then only—a sign appears in<br/>the ground-floor lobby of the Bank of England announcing the new rate, and, simultaneously, a<br/>functionary called the Government Broker, decked out in a pink coat and top hat, hurries down<br/>Throgmorton Street to the London Stock Exchange and ceremonially announces the new rate from a<br/>rostrum. Noon on Thursday the twelfth passed with no change; evidently the Labour Government was<br/>having as much trouble deciding on a bank-rate rise after the election as the Conservatives had had<br/>before. The speculators, wherever they were, reacted to such pusillanimity as one man. On Friday the<br/>thirteenth, the pound, which had been moderately buoyant all week precisely because speculators had<br/>been anticipating a bank-rate rise, underwent a fearful battering, which sent it down to a closing price</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>of $2.7829—barely more than a quarter of a cent above the official minimum—and the Bank of<br/>England, intervening frequently to hold it even at that level, lost twenty-eight million dollars more<br/>from its reserves. Next day, the financial commentator of the London </span><i>Times</i><span>, under the byline Our City<br/>Editor, let himself go. “The pound,” he wrote, “is not looking as firm as might be hoped.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark372">THE </a><span class="p">following week saw the pattern repeated, but in exaggerated form. On Monday, Prime Minister<br/>Wilson, taking a leaf out of Winston Churchill’s book, tried rhetoric as a weapon. Speaking at a<br/>pomp-and-circumstance banquet at the Guildhall in the City of London before an audience that<br/>included, among many other dignitaries, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord<br/>President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Mayor of London, and their wives, Wilson<br/>ringingly proclaimed “not only our faith but our determination to keep sterling strong and to see it<br/>riding high,” and asserted that the Government would not hesitate to take whatever steps might<br/>become necessary to accomplish this purpose. While elaborately avoiding the dread word<br/>“devaluation,” just as all other British officials had avoided it all summer, Wilson sought to make it<br/>unmistakable that the Government now considered such a move out of the question. To emphasize this<br/>point, he included a warning to speculators: “If anyone at home or abroad doubts the firmness of [our]<br/>resolve, let them be prepared to pay the price for their lack of faith in Britain.” Perhaps the<br/>speculators were daunted by this verbal volley, or perhaps they were again moved to let up in their<br/>assault on the pound by the prospect of a bank-rate rise on Thursday; in any case, on Tuesday and<br/>Wednesday the pound, though it hardly rode high in the marketplace, managed to ride a little less low<br/>than it had on the previous Friday, and to do so without the help of the Bank of England.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>By Thursday, according to subsequent reports, a sharp private dispute had erupted between the<br/>Bank of England and the British government on the bank-rate question—Lord Cromer arguing, for the<br/>bank, that a rise of at least one per cent, and perhaps two per cent, was absolutely essential, and<br/>Wilson, Brown, and Callaghan still demurring. The upshot was no bank-rate rise on Thursday, and the<br/>effect of the inaction was a swift intensification of the crisis. Friday the twentieth was a black day in<br/>the City of London. The Stock Exchange, its investors moving in time with sterling, had a terrible<br/>session. The Bank of England had by now resolved to establish its last-line trench on the pound at</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark373"><span>$2.7825—a quarter of a cent above the bottom limit. The pound opened on Friday at precisely that<br/>level and remained there all day, firmly pinned down by the speculators’ hail of offers to sell;<br/>meanwhile, the bank met all offers at $2.7825 and, in doing so, used up more of Britain’s reserves.<br/>Now the offers were coming so fast that little attempt was made to disguise their places of origin; it<br/>was evident that they were coming from everywhere—chiefly from the financial centers of Europe,<br/>but also from New York, and even from London itself. Rumors of imminent devaluation were<br/>sweeping the bourses of the Continent. And in London itself an ominous sign of cracking morale<br/>appeared: devaluation was now being mentioned openly even there. The Swedish economist and<br/>sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, in a luncheon speech in London on Thursday, had suggested that a slight<br/>devaluation might now be the only possible solution to Britain’s problems; once this exogenous<br/>comment had broken the ice, Britons also began using the dread word, and, in the next morning’s<br/></span></a><i>Times</i><span>, Our City Editor himself was to say, in the tone of a commander preparing the garrison for<br/>possible surrender, “Indiscriminate gossip about devaluation of the pound can do harm. But it would<br/>be even worse to regard use of that word as taboo.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>When nightfall at last brought the pound and its defenders a weekend breather, the Bank of England<br/>had a chance to assess its situation. What it found was anything but reassuring. All but a fraction of<br/>the billion dollars it had arranged to borrow in September under the expanded swap agreements had</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>gone into the battle. The right that remained to it of drawing on the International Monetary Fund was<br/>virtually worthless, since the transaction would take weeks to complete, and matters turned on days<br/>and hours. What the bank still had—and all that it had—was the British reserves, which had gone<br/>down by fifty-six million dollars that day and now stood at around two billion. More than one<br/>commentator has since suggested that this sum could in a way be likened to the few squadrons of<br/>fighter planes to which the same dogged nation had been reduced twenty-four years earlier at the<br/>worst point in the Battle of Britain.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark374"><span class="s6">THE </span></a><span>analogy is extravagant, and yet, in the light of what the pound means, and has meant, to the<br/>British, it is not irrelevant. In a materialistic age, the pound has almost the symbolic importance that<br/>was once accorded to the Crown; the state of sterling almost </span><i>is </i><span>the state of Britain. The pound is the<br/>oldest of modern currencies. The term “pound sterling” is believed to have originated well before the<br/>Norman Conquest, when the Saxon kings issued silver pennies—called “sterlings” or “starlings”<br/>because they sometimes had stars inscribed on them—of which two hundred and forty equalled one<br/>pound of pure silver. (The shilling, representing twelve sterlings, or one-twentieth of a pound, did not<br/>appear on the scene until after the Conquest.) Thus, sizable payments in Britain have been reckoned in<br/>pounds from its beginnings. The pound, however, was by no means an unassailably sound currency<br/>during its first few centuries, chiefly because of the early kings’ unfortunate habit of relieving their<br/>chronic financial embarrassment by debasing the coinage. By melting down a quantity of sterlings,<br/>adding to the brew some base metal and no more silver, and then minting new coins, an irresponsible<br/>king could magically convert a hundred pounds into, say, a hundred and ten, just like that. Queen<br/>Elizabeth I put a stop to the practice when, in a carefully planned surprise move in 1561, she recalled<br/>from circulation all the debased coins issued by her predecessors. The result, combined with the<br/>growth of British trade, was a rapid and spectacular rise in the prestige of the pound, and less than a<br/>century after Elizabeth’s coup the word “sterling” had assumed the adjectival meaning that it still has</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—“thoroughly excellent, capable of standing every test.” By the end of the seventeenth century, when<br/>the Bank of England was founded to handle the government’s finances, paper money was beginning to<br/>be trusted for general use, and it had come to be backed by gold as well as silver. As time went on,<br/>the monetary prestige of gold rose steadily in relation to that of silver (in the modern world silver has<br/>no standing as a monetary reserve metal, and only in some half-dozen countries does it now serve as<br/>the principal metal in subsidiary coinage), but it was not until 1816 that Britain adopted a gold<br/>standard—that is, pledged itself to redeem paper currency with gold coins or bars at any time. The<br/>gold sovereign, worth one pound, which came to symbolize stability, affluence, and even joy to more<br/>Victorians  than Bagehot, made its first appearance in 1817.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark375"><span>Prosperity begat emulation. Seeing how Britain flourished, and believing the gold standard to be at<br/>least partly responsible, other nations adopted it one after  another: Germany in 1871; Sweden,<br/>Norway, and Denmark in 1873; France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece in 1874; the<br/>Netherlands in 1875; and the United States in 1879. The results were disappointing; hardly any of the<br/>newcomers found themselves immediately getting rich, and Britain, which in retrospect appears to<br/>have flourished as much in spite of the gold standard as because of it, continued to be the undisputed<br/>monarch of world trade. In the half  century preceding the First World War, London was the<br/>middleman in international finance, and the pound was its quasi-official medium. As David Lloyd<br/>George was later to write nostalgically, prior to 1914 “the crackle of a bill on London”—that is, of a<br/>bill of credit in pounds sterling bearing the signature of a London bank—“was as good as the ring of<br/>gold in any port throughout the civilized world.” The war ended this idyll by disrupting the delicate</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>balance of forces that had made it possible and by bringing to the fore a challenger to the pound’s<br/>supremacy—the United States dollar. In 1914, Britain, hard pressed to finance its fighting forces,<br/>adopted measures to discourage demands for gold, thereby abandoning the gold standard in<br/>everything but name; meanwhile, the value of a pound in dollars sank from $4.86 to a 1920 low of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$3.20. In an effort to recoup its lost glory, Britain resumed a full gold standard in 1925, tying the<br/>pound to gold at a rate that restored its old $4.86 relation to the dollar. The cost of this gallant<br/>overvaluation, however, was chronic depression at home, not to mention the political eclipse for<br/>some fifteen years of the Chancellor of the Exchequer who ordered it, Winston Churchill.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark376"><span>The general collapse of currencies during the nineteen-thirties actually began not in London but on<br/>the Continent, when, in the summer of 1931, a sudden run on the leading bank of Austria, the<br/>Creditanstalt, resulted in its failure. The domino principle of bank failures—if such a thing can be<br/>said to exist—then came into play. German losses arising from this relatively minor disaster resulted<br/>in a banking crisis in Germany, and then, because huge quantities of British funds were now frozen in<br/>bankrupt institutions on the Continent, the panic crossed the English Channel and invaded the home of<br/>the imperial pound itself. Demands for gold in exchange for pounds quickly became too heavy for the<br/>Bank of England to meet, even with the help of loans from France and the United States. Britain was<br/>faced with the bleak alternatives of setting an almost usurious bank rate—between eight and ten per<br/>cent—in order to hold funds in London and check the gold outflow, or abandoning the gold standard;<br/>the first choice, which would have further depressed the domestic economy, in which there were now<br/>more than two and a half million unemployed, was considered unconscionable, and accordingly, on<br/>September 21, 1931, the Bank of England announced suspension of its responsibility to sell gold.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The move hit the financial world like a thunderbolt. So great was the prestige of the pound in 1931<br/>that John Maynard Keynes, the already famous British economist, could say, not wholly in irony, that<br/>sterling hadn’t left gold, gold had left sterling. In either case, the mooring of the old system was gone,<br/>and chaos was the result. Within a few weeks, all the countries on the vast portion of the globe then<br/>under British political or economic domination had left the gold standard, most of the other leading<br/>currencies had either left gold or been drastically devalued in relation to it, and in the free market the<br/>value of the pound in terms of dollars had dropped from $4.86 to around $3.50. Then the dollar itself</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark377"><span>—the potential new mooring—came loose. In 1933, the United States, compelled by the worst<br/>depression in its history, abandoned the gold standard. A year later, it resumed it in a modified form<br/>called the gold-exchange standard, under which gold coinage was ended and the Federal Reserve<br/>was pledged to sell gold in bar form to other central banks but to no one else—and to sell it at a<br/>drastic devaluation of forty-one per cent from the old price. The United States devaluation restored<br/>the pound to its old dollar parity, but Britain found it small comfort to be tied securely to a mooring<br/>that was now shaky itself. Even so, over the next five years, while beggar-my-neighbor came to be the<br/>rule in international finance, the pound did not lose much more ground in relation to other currencies,<br/>and when the Second World War broke out, the British government boldly pegged it at $4.03 and<br/>imposed controls to keep it there in defiance of the free market. There, for a decade, it remained—but<br/>only officially. In the free market of neutral Switzerland, it fluctuated all through the war in reflection<br/>of Britain’s military fortunes, sinking at the darkest moments to as low as $2.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>In the postwar era, the pound has been almost continuously in trouble. The new rules of the game of<br/>international finance that were agreed upon at Bretton Woods recognized that the old gold standard<br/>had been far too rigid and the virtual paper standard of the nineteen-thirties far too unstable; a<br/>compromise accordingly emerged, under which the dollar—the new king of currencies—remained<br/>tied to gold under the gold-exchange standard, and the pound, along with the other leading currencies,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>became tied not to gold but to the dollar, at rates fixed within stated limits. Indeed, the postwar era<br/>was virtually ushered in by a devaluation of the pound that was about as drastic in amount as that of<br/>1931, though far less so in its consequences. The pound, like most European currencies, had emerged<br/>from Bretton Woods flagrantly overvalued in relation to the shattered economy it represented, and<br/>had been kept that way only by government-imposed controls. In the autumn of 1949, therefore, after a<br/>year and a half of devaluation rumors, burgeoning black markets in sterling, and gold losses that had<br/>reduced the British reserves to a dangerously low level, the pound was devalued from $4.03 to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark378"><span>$2.80. With the isolated exceptions of the United States dollar and the Swiss franc, every important<br/>non-Communist currency almost instantly followed the pound’s example, but this time no drying up of<br/>trade, or other chaos, ensued, because the 1949 devaluations, unlike those of 1931 and the years<br/>following, were not the uncontrolled attempts of countries riddled by depression to gain a<br/>competitive advantage at any cost but merely represented recognition by the war-devastated countries<br/>that they had recovered to the point where they could survive relatively free international competition<br/>without artificial props. In fact, world trade, instead of drying up, picked up sharply. But even at the<br/>new, more rational evaluation the pound continued its career of hairbreadth escapes. Sterling crises<br/>of varying magnitudes were weathered in 1952, 1955, 1957, and 1961. In its unsentimental and<br/>tactless way, the pound—just as by its gyrations in the past it had accurately charted Britain’s rise<br/>and fall as the greatest of world powers—now, with its nagging recurrent weakness, seemed to be<br/>hinting that even such retrenchment as the British had undertaken in 1949 was not enough to suit their<br/>reduced circumstances.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And in November, 1964, these hints, with their humiliating implications, were not lost on the<br/>British people. The emotional terms in which many of them were thinking about the pound were well<br/>illustrated by an exchange that took place in that celebrated forum the letters column of the </span><i>Times</i><span>when the crisis was at its height. A reader named I. M. D. Little wrote deploring all the breast-<br/>beating about the pound and particularly the uneasy whispering about devaluation—a matter that he<br/>declared to be an economic rather than a moral issue. Quick as a flash came a reply from a C. S.<br/>Hadfield, among others. Was there ever a clearer sign of soulless times, Hadfield demanded, than<br/>Little’s letter? Devaluation not a moral issue? “Repudiation—for that is what devaluation is, neither<br/>more nor less—has become respectable!” Hadfield groaned, in the unmistakable tone, as old in<br/>Britain as the pound itself, of the outraged patriot.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark379"><span class="s6">IN </span></a><span>the ten days following the Basel meeting, the first concern of the men at the Federal Reserve Bank<br/>of New York was not the pound but the dollar. The American balance-of-payments deficit had now<br/>crept up to the alarming rate of almost six billion dollars a year, and it was becoming clear that a rise<br/>in the British bank rate, if it should be unmatched by American action, might merely shift some of the<br/>speculative attack from the pound to the dollar. Hayes and Coombs and the Washington monetary<br/>authorities—William McChesney Martin, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Secretary of the<br/>Treasury     Douglas Dillon, and Under-Secretary of the Treasury Robert Roosa—came to agree that if<br/>the British should raise their rate the Federal Reserve would be compelled, in self-defense, to<br/>competitively raise </span><i>its </i><span>rate above the current level of three and a half per cent. Hayes had numerous<br/>telephone conversations on this delicate point with his London counterpart, Lord Cromer. A deep-<br/>dyed aristocrat—a godson of King George V and a grandson of Sir Evelyn Baring, later the first Earl<br/>of Cromer (who, as the British agent in Egypt, was Chinese Gordon’s nemesis in 1884–85)—Lord<br/>Cromer was also a banker of universally acknowledged brilliance and, at forty-three, the youngest<br/>man, as far as anyone could remember, ever to direct the fortunes of the Bank of England; he and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hayes, in the course of their frequent meetings at Basel and elsewhere, had become warm friends.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>During the afternoon of Friday the twentieth, at any rate, the Federal Reserve Bank had a chance to<br/>show its good intentions by doing some front-line fighting for the pound. The breather provided by the<br/>London closing proved to be illusory; five o’clock in London was only noon in New York, and<br/>insatiable speculators were able to go on selling pounds for several more hours in the New York<br/>market, with the result that the trading room of the Federal Reserve Bank temporarily replaced that of<br/>the Bank of England as the command post for the defense. Using as their ammunition British dollars—<br/>or, more precisely, United States dollars lent to Britain under the swap agreements—the Federal<br/>Reserve’s traders staunchly held the pound at or above $2.7825, at ever-increasing cost, of course, to<br/>the British reserves. Mercifully, after the New York closing the battle did not follow the sun to San<br/>Francisco and on around the world to Tokyo. Evidently, the attackers had had their fill, at least for the<br/>time being.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark380"><span>What followed was one of those strange modern weekends in which weighty matters are discussed<br/>and weighty decisions taken among men who are ostensibly sitting around relaxing in various parts of<br/>the world. Wilson, Brown, and Callaghan were at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s country estate,<br/>taking part in a conference that had originally been scheduled to cover the subject of national-defense<br/>policy. Lord Cromer was at his country place in Westerham, Kent. Martin, Dillon, and Roosa were at<br/>their offices or their homes, in and around Washington. Coombs was at his home, in Green Village,<br/>New Jersey, and Hayes was visiting friends of his elsewhere in New Jersey. At Chequers, Wilson<br/>and his two financial ministers, leaving the military brass to confer about defense policy with each<br/>other, adjourned to an upstairs gallery to tackle the sterling crisis; in order to bring Lord Cromer into<br/>their deliberations, they kept a telephone circuit open to him in Kent, using a scrambler system when<br/>they talked on it, so as to avoid interception of their words by their unseen enemies the speculators.<br/>Sometime on Saturday, the British reached their decision. Not only would they raise the bank rate,<br/>and raise it two per cent above its current level—to seven per cent—but, in defiance of custom, they<br/>would do so the first thing Monday morning, rather than wait for another Thursday to roll around. For<br/>one thing, they reasoned, to postpone action until  Thursday would mean three and a half more<br/>business days during which the deadly drain of British reserves would almost certainly continue and<br/>might well accelerate; for another, the sheer shock of the deliberate violation of custom would serve<br/>to dramatize the government’s determination. The decision, once taken, was communicated by British<br/>intermediaries in Washington to the American monetary officials there, and relayed to Hayes and<br/>Coombs in New Jersey. Those two, knowing that the agreed-upon plan for a concomitant rise in the<br/>New York bank rate would now have to be put into effect as quickly as possible, got to work on the<br/>telephone lining up a Monday-afternoon meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors,<br/>without whose initiative the rate could not be changed. Hayes, a man who sets great store by<br/>politeness, has since said, with considerable chagrin, that he fears he was the despair of his hostess<br/>that weekend; not only was he on the telephone most of the time but he was prevented by the<br/>circumstances from giving the slightest explanation of his unseemly behavior.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark381"><span>What had been done—or, rather, was about to be done—in Britain was plenty to flutter the<br/>dovecotes of international finance. Since the beginning of the First World War, the bank rate there had<br/>never gone higher than seven per cent and had only occasionally gone that high; as for a bank-rate<br/>change on a day other than Thursday, the last time that had occurred, ominously enough, was in 1931.<br/>Anticipating lively action at the London opening, which would take place at about 5 </span></a><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>New York<br/>time, Coombs went to Liberty Street on Sunday afternoon in order to spend the night at the bank and<br/>be on hand when the transatlantic doings began. As an overnight companion he had a man who found</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>it advisable to sleep at the bank so often that he habitually kept a packed suitcase in his office—<br/>Thomas J. Roche, at that time the senior foreign-exchange officer. Roche welcomed his boss to the<br/>sleeping quarters—a row of small, motel-like rooms on the eleventh floor, each equipped with maple<br/>furniture, Old New York prints, a telephone, a clock radio, a bathrobe, and a shaving kit—and the<br/>two men discussed the weekend’s developments for a while before turning in. Shortly before five in<br/>the morning, their radios woke them, and, after a breakfast provided by the night staff, they repaired to<br/>the foreign-exchange trading room, on the seventh floor, to man their fluoroscope.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At five-ten, they were on the phone to the Bank of England, getting the news. The bank-rate rise had<br/>been announced promptly at the opening of the London markets, to the accompaniment of great<br/>excitement; later Coombs was to learn that the Government Broker’s entrance into the Stock<br/>Exchange, which is usually the occasion for a certain hush, had this time been greeted with such an<br/>uproar that he had had difficulty making his news known. As for the first market reaction of the pound,<br/>it was (one commentator said later) like that of a race horse to dope; in the ten minutes following the<br/>bank-rate announcement it shot up to $2.7869, far above its Friday closing. A few minutes later, the<br/>early-rising New Yorkers were on the phone to the Deutsche Bundesbank, the central bank of West<br/>Germany, in Frankfurt, and the Swiss National Bank, in Zurich, sounding out Continental reaction. It<br/>was equally good. Then they were back in touch with the Bank of England, where things were looking<br/>better and better. The speculators against the pound were on the run, rushing now to cover their short<br/>sales, and by the time the first gray light began to show in the windows on Liberty Street, Coombs had<br/>heard that the pound was being quoted in London at $2.79—its best price since July, when the crisis<br/>started.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark382"><span>It went on that way all day. “Seven per cent will drag money from the moon,” a Swiss banker<br/>commented, paraphrasing the great Bagehot, who had said, in his earthbound, Victorian way, “Seven<br/>per cent will pull gold out of the ground.” In London, the sense of security was so strong that it<br/>allowed a return to political bickering as usual; in Parliament, Reginald Maudling, the chief economic<br/>authority of the out-of-office Conservatives, took the occasion to remark that there wouldn’t have<br/>been a crisis in the first place but for the actions of the Labour Government, and Chancellor of the<br/>Exchequer Callaghan replied, with deadly politeness, “I must remind the honorable gentleman that he<br/>told us [recently] we had inherited his problems.” Everybody was clearly breathing easier. As for the<br/>Bank of England, so great was the sudden clamor for pounds that it saw a chance to replenish its<br/>depleted supply of dollars, and for a time that afternoon it actually felt confident enough to switch<br/>sides in the market, buying dollars with pounds at just below $2.79. In New York, the mood persisted<br/>after the London closing. It was with a clear conscience about the pound that the directors of the<br/>Federal Reserve Bank of New York could—and, that afternoon, did—carry out their plan to raise<br/>their lending rate from three and a half per cent to four per cent. Coombs has since said, “The feeling<br/>here on Monday afternoon was: They’ve done it—they’ve pulled through again. There was a general<br/>sigh of relief. The sterling crisis seemed to be over.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>It wasn’t, though. “I remember that the situation changed very fast on Tuesday the twenty-fourth,”<br/>Hayes has said. That day’s opening found the pound looking firm at $2.7875. Substantial buying<br/>orders for pounds were coming in now from Germany, and the day ahead looked satisfactory. So<br/>things continued until 6 </span><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>in New York—noon on the Continent. It is around then that the various<br/>bourses of Europe—including the most important ones, in Paris and Frankfurt—hold the meetings at<br/>which they set the day’s rate for each currency, for the purpose of settling transactions in stocks and<br/>bonds that involve foreign currency, and these price-fixing sessions are bound to influence the money<br/>markets, since they give a clear indication of the most influential Continental sentiment in regard to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>each currency. The bourse rates set for the pound that day were such as to show a renewed, and<br/>pronounced, lack of confidence. At the same time, it appeared subsequently, money dealers<br/>everywhere, and particularly in Europe, were having second thoughts about the manner of the bank-<br/>rate rise the previous day. At first, taken by surprise, they had reacted enthusiastically, but now, it<br/>seemed, they had belatedly decided that the making of the announcement on Monday indicated that<br/>Britain was losing its grip. “What would it connote if the British were to play a Cup final on<br/>Sunday?” a European banker is said to have asked a colleague. The only possible answer was that it<br/>would connote panic in Albion.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The effect of these second thoughts was an astonishingly drastic turnabout in market action. In New<br/>York between eight and nine, Coombs, in the trading room, watched with a sinking heart as a tranquil<br/>pound market collapsed into a rout. Selling orders in unheard-of quantities were coming from<br/>everywhere. The Bank of England, with the courage of desperation, advanced its last-line trench from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>$2.7825 to $2.7860, and, by constant intervention, held the pound there. But it was clear that the cost<br/>would soon become too high; a few minutes after 9 </span><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>New York time, Coombs calculated that<br/>Britain was losing reserves at the unprecedented, and unsupportable, rate of a million dollars a<br/>minute.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark383"><span>Hayes, arriving at the bank shortly after nine, had hardly sat down at his desk before this unsettling<br/>news reached him from the seventh floor. “We’re in for a hurricane,” Coombs told him, and went on<br/>to say that the pressure on sterling was now mounting so fast that there was a real likelihood that<br/>Britain might be forced either to devalue or to impose a sweeping—and, for many reasons,<br/>unacceptable—system of exchange controls before the week was out. Hayes immediately telephoned<br/>the governors of the leading European central banks—some of whom, because not all the national<br/>markets had yet felt the full weight of the crisis, were startled to hear exactly how grave the situation<br/>was—and pleaded with them not to exacerbate the pressure on both the pound and the dollar by<br/>raising their own bank rates. (His job was scarcely made easier by the fact that he had to admit that<br/>his own bank had just raised </span></a><i>its </i><span>rate.) Then he asked Coombs to come up to his office. The pound, the<br/>two men agreed, now had its back to the wall; the British bank-rate rise had obviously failed of its<br/>purpose, and at the million-a-minute rate of loss Britain’s well of reserves would be dry in less than<br/>five business days. The one hope now lay in amassing, within a matter of hours, or within a day or so<br/>at the most, a huge bundle of credit from outside Britain to enable the Bank of England to survive the<br/>attack and beat it back. Such rescue bundles had been assembled just a handful of times before—for<br/>Canada in 1962, for Italy earlier in 1964, and for Britain in 1961—but this time, it was clear, a much<br/>bigger bundle than any of those would be needed. The central-banking world was faced not so much<br/>with an opportunity for building a milestone in the short history of international monetary coöperation<br/>as with the necessity for doing so.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Two other things were clear—that, in view of the dollar’s troubles, the United States could not<br/>hope to rescue the pound unassisted, and that, the dollar’s troubles notwithstanding, the United States,<br/>with all its economic might, would have to join the Bank of England in initiating any rescue operation.<br/>As a first step, Coombs suggested that the Federal Reserve standby credit to the Bank of England<br/>ought to be increased forthwith from five hundred million dollars to seven hundred and fifty million.<br/>Unfortunately, fast action on this proposal was hampered by the fact that, under the Federal Reserve<br/>Act, any such move could be made only by decision of a Federal Reserve System committee, whose<br/>members were scattered all over the country. Hayes conferred by long-distance telephone (all around<br/>the world, wires were now humming with news of the pound’s extremity) with the Washington<br/>monetary contingent, Martin, Dillon, and Roosa, none of whom disagreed with Coombs’ view of what</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark384"><span>had to be done, and as a result of these discussions a call went out from Martin’s office to members<br/>of the key committee, called the Open Market Committee, for a meeting by telephone at three o’clock<br/>that afternoon. Roosa, at the Treasury, suggested that the United States’ contribution to the kitty could<br/>be further increased by arranging for a two-hundred-and-fifty-million-dollar loan from the Export-<br/>Import Bank, a Treasury-owned and Treasury-financed institution in Washington. Hayes and Coombs<br/>were naturally in favor of this, and Roosa set in motion the bureaucratic machinery to unlock that<br/>particular vault—a process that, he warned, would certainly take until evening.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>As the early afternoon passed in New York, with the millions of dollars continuing to drain, minute<br/>by minute, from Britain’s reserves, Hayes and Coombs, along with their Washington colleagues, were<br/>busy planning the next step. If the swap increase and the Export-Import Bank loan should come<br/>through, the United States credits would amount to a billion dollars all told; now, in consultation with<br/>the beleaguered garrison at the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank men began to believe that,<br/>in order to make the operation effective, the other leading central banks—spoken of in central-<br/>banking shorthand as “the Continent,” even though they include the Banks of Canada and Japan—<br/>would have to be asked to put up additional credits on the order of one and a half billion dollars, or<br/>possibly even more. Such a sum would make the Continent, collectively, a bigger contributor to the<br/>cause than the United States—a fact that Hayes and Coombs realized might not sit too well with the<br/>Continental bankers and their governments.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>At three o’clock, the Open Market Committee held its telephone meeting—twelve men sitting at<br/>their desks  in six cities, from New York to San Francisco. The members  heard Coombs’ dry,<br/>unemotional voice describing the situation and making his recommendation. They were quickly<br/>convinced. In no more than fifteen minutes, they had voted unanimously to increase the swap credit to<br/>seven hundred and fifty million dollars, on condition that proportional credit assistance could be<br/>obtained from other central banks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark385"><span>By late afternoon, tentative word had come from Washington that prospects for the Export-Import<br/>Bank loan looked good, and that more definite word could be expected before midnight. So the one<br/>billion dollars in United States credits appeared to be virtually in the bag. It remained to tackle the<br/>Continent. It was night now in Europe, so nobody there could be tackled; the zero hour, then, was<br/>Continental opening time the next day, and the crucial period for the fate of the pound would be the<br/>few hours after that. Hayes, after leaving instructions for a bank car to pick him up at his home, in<br/>New Canaan, Connecticut, at four o’clock in the morning, took his usual commuting train from Grand<br/>Central shortly after five. He has since expressed a certain regret that he proceeded in such a routine<br/>way at such a dramatic moment. “I left the bank rather reluctantly,” he says. “In retrospect, I guess I<br/>wish I hadn’t. I don’t mean as a practical matter—I was just as useful at home, and, as a matter of<br/>fact, I ended up spending most of the evening on the phone with Charlie Coombs, who stayed at the<br/>bank—but just because something like that doesn’t happen every day in a banker’s life. I’m a creature<br/>of habit, I guess. Besides, it’s something of a tenet of mine to insist on keeping a proper balance<br/>between private and professional life.” Although Hayes does not say so, he may have been thinking of<br/>something else, too. It can safely be said to be something of a tenet of central-bank presidents or<br/>governors not to sleep at their places of business. If word were ever to get out that the methodical<br/>Hayes was doing so at a time like this, he may have reasoned, it might well be considered just as<br/>much a sign of panic as a British bank-rate rise on a Monday.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Meanwhile, Coombs was making another night of it on Liberty Street; he had gone home the<br/>previous night because the worst had momentarily appeared to be over, but now he stayed on after<br/>regular work hours with Roche, who hadn’t been home since the previous weekend. Toward</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>midnight, Coombs received confirmation of the Export-Import Bank’s two-hundred-and-fifty-million-<br/>dollar credit, which had arrived from  Washington during the evening, as promised. So now<br/>everything was braced for the morning’s effort. Coombs again installed himself in one of the<br/>uninspiring eleventh-floor cubicles, and, after a final marshalling of the facts that would be needed<br/>for the job of persuading the Continental bankers, set his clock radio for three-thirty and went to bed.<br/>A Federal Reserve man with a literary bent and a romantic temperament was later moved to draw a<br/>parallel between the Federal Reserve Bank that night and the British camp on the eve of the Battle of<br/>Agincourt in Shakespeare’s version, in which King Henry mused so eloquently on how participation<br/>in the coming action would serve to ennoble even the vilest of the troops, and how gentlemen safe in<br/>bed at home would later think themselves accursed that they had not been at the battle scene. Coombs,<br/>a practical man, had no such high-flown opinion of his situation; even so, as he dozed fitfully, waiting<br/>for morning to reach Europe, he was well aware that the events he was taking part in were like<br/>nothing that had ever happened in banking before.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">II</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>So that evening, Tuesday, November 24, 1964, Hayes arrived at his home, in New Canaan,<br/>Connecticut, at about six-thirty, exactly as usual, having inexorably taken his usual 5:09 from Grand<br/>Central. Hayes was a tall, slim, soft-spoken man of fifty-four with keen eyes framed by owlish round<br/>spectacles, with a slightly schoolmasterish air and a reputation for unflappability. By so methodically<br/>going through familiar motions at such a time, he realized with amusement, he must seem to his<br/>colleagues to be living up to his reputation rather spectacularly. At his house, a former caretaker’s<br/>cottage of circa 1840 that the Hayeses had bought and remodelled twelve years earlier, he was<br/>greeted, as usual, by his wife, a pretty and vivacious woman of Anglo-Italian descent named Vilma<br/>but always called Bebba, who loves to travel, has almost no interest in banking, and is the daughter of<br/>the late Metropolitan Opera baritone Thomas Chalmers. Since at that time of year it was completely<br/>dark when Hayes got home, he decided to forgo a favorite early-evening unwinding activity of his—<br/>walking to the top of a grassy slope beside the house which commands a fine view across the Sound<br/>to Long Island. Anyway, he was not really in a mood to unwind; instead, he felt keyed up, and<br/>decidedhe might as well stay that way overnight, since the car from the bank was scheduled to call at<br/>his door so early the next morning to take him to work.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>During dinner, Hayes and his wife discussed subjects like the fact that their son, Tom, who was a<br/>senior at Harvard, would be arriving home the following day for his Thanksgiving recess. Afterward,<br/>Hayes settled down in an armchair to read for a while. In banking circles, he is thought of as a<br/>scholarly, intellectual type, and, indeed, he </span><i>is </i><span>scholarly and intellectual in comparison with most<br/>bankers; even so, his extra-banking reading tends to be not constant and all-embracing, as his wife’s<br/>is, but sporadic, capricious, and intensive—everything about Napoleon for a while, perhaps, then a<br/>dry period, then a binge on, say, the Civil War. Just then, he was concentrating on the island of Corfu,<br/>where he and Mrs. Hayes were planning to spend some time. But before he had got very far into his<br/>latest Corfu book he was called to the telephone. The call was from the bank. There were new<br/>developments, which Coombs thought President Hayes ought to be kept abreast of.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>To recapitulate in brief: drastic action to save the pound, which the Federal Reserve Bank not only<br/>would be intimately involved in but would actually join in initiating, was going to be taken by the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>government banks—or central banks, as they are more commonly called—of the non-Communist<br/>world’s leading nations as soon as possible after the next morning’s opening of the London and<br/>Continental financial markets, which would occur between 4 and 5 </span><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>New York time. Britain was<br/>face to face with bankruptcy, the reasons being that a huge deficit in its international accounts over the<br/>previous months had resulted in concomitant losses in the gold and dollar reserves held by the Bank<br/>of England; that worldwide fear lest the newly elected Labour Government decide, or be forced, to<br/>ease the situation by devaluing the pound from its dollar parity of about $2.80 to some substantially<br/>lower figure had caused a flood of selling of pounds by hedgers and speculators in the international<br/>money markets; that the Bank of England, fulfilling an international obligation to sustain the pound at a<br/>free-market price no lower than $2.78, had been losing millions of dollars a day from its reserves,<br/>which now stood at about two billion dollars, their lowest point in many years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark386"><span>The remaining hope lay in amassing, in a matter of hours before it would be too late, an unheard-of<br/>sum in short-term dollar credits to Britain from the central banks of the world’s rich nations. With<br/>such credits at its disposal, the Bank of England would presumably be able to buy up pounds so<br/>aggressively that the speculative attack could be absorbed, contained, and finally beaten back, giving<br/>Britain time to set its economic affairs in order. Just what the sum necessary for rescue should be was<br/>an open question, but earlier that day the monetary authorities of the United States and Britain had<br/>concluded that it would have to be at least two billion dollars, and perhaps even more. The United<br/>States, through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Treasury-owned Export-Import Bank,<br/>in Washington, had that day committed itself to one billion; the task that remained was to persuade the<br/>other leading central banks—habitually spoken of in the central-banking world as “the Continent,”<br/>even though they include the Banks of Canada and Japan—to lend more than a billion in addition.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Nothing of the kind had ever been asked of the Continent before, through the swap network or any<br/>other way. In September, 1964, the Continent had come through with its biggest collective emergency<br/>credit so far—half a billion dollars to the Bank of England for use in defending the pound, already<br/>embattled then. Now, with this half-billion loan still outstanding and the pound in far worse straits,<br/>the Continent was about to be called upon for more than twice that sum—perhaps five times that sum.<br/>Obviously, the spirit of coöperation, if not the quality of mercy, was about to be strained. So Hayes’<br/>musings that evening may well have run.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>With such portentous matters churning around in his head, Hayes found it hard to keep his mind on<br/>Corfu. Besides, the prospect of the bank car’s arrival at four o’clock made him feel that he should go<br/>to bed early. As he prepared to do so, Mrs. Hayes commented that since he would have to get up in<br/>the middle of the night, she supposed she ought to feel sorry for him but since he was obviously<br/>looking forward with keen anticipation to whatever it was that would get him up at that hour, she<br/>envied him instead.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DOWN <span class="p">on Liberty Street, Coombs slept fitfully until he was awakened by the clock radio in his room<br/>at about three-thirty New York time—that is to say, eight-thirty London time and nine-thirty farther<br/>east  on the European Continent. A series of foreign-exchange crises involving Europe had so<br/>accustomed him to the time differential that he was inclined to think in terms of the European day,<br/>referring casually to 8 </span>A.M. <span class="p">in New York as “lunchtime,” and 9 </span>A.M. <span class="p">as “midafternoon.” So when he<br/>got up it was, in his terms, “morning,” despite the stars that were shining over Liberty Street. Coombs<br/>got dressed, went to his office, on the tenth floor, where he had some breakfast provided by the<br/>bank’s regular night kitchen staff, and began placing telephone calls to the various leading central<br/>banks of the non-Communist world. All the calls were put through by one telephone operator, who</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>handles the Federal Reserve Bank’s switchboard during off hours, and all of them were eligible for a<br/>special government-emergency priority that the bank’s officers are entitled to claim, but on this<br/>occasion it did not have to be used, because at four-fifteen, when Coombs began his telephoning, the<br/>transatlantic circuits were almost entirely clear.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The calls were made essentially to lay the groundwork for what was to come. The morning news<br/>from the Bank of England, obtained in one of the first calls from Liberty Street, was that conditions<br/>were unchanged from the previous day: the speculative attack on the pound was continuing unabated,<br/>and the Bank of England was sustaining the pound’s price at $2.7860 by throwing still more of its<br/>reserves on the market. Coombs had reason to believe that when the New York foreign-exchange<br/>market opened, some five hours later, vast additional quantities of pounds would be thrown on the<br/>market on this side of the Atlantic, and more British dollars and gold would have to be spent. He<br/>conveyed this alarming intelligence to his counterparts at such institutions as the Deutsche<br/>Bundesbank, in Frankfurt; the Banque de France, in Paris; the Banca d’Italia, in Rome; and the Bank<br/>of Japan, in Tokyo. (In the last case, the officers had to be reached at their homes, for the fourteen-<br/>hour time difference made it already past 6 </span><span class="s6">P.M. </span><span>in the Orient.) Then, coming to the crux of the matter,<br/>Coombs informed the representatives of the various banks that they were soon to be asked, in behalf<br/>of the Bank of England, for a loan far bigger than any they had ever been asked for before. “Without<br/>going into specific figures, I tried to make the point that it was a crisis of the first magnitude, which<br/>many of them still didn’t realize,” Coombs has said. An officer of the Bundesbank, who knew as much<br/>about the extent of the crisis as anyone outside London, Washington, and New York, has said that in<br/>Frankfurt they were “mentally prepared”—or “braced” might be a better word—for the huge touch<br/>that was about to be put on them, but that right up to the time of Coombs’ call they had been hoping the<br/>speculative attack on the pound would subside of its own accord, and even after the call they had no<br/>idea how much they might be asked for. In any event, as soon as Coombs was off the wire the<br/>Bundesbank’s governor called a board of managers’ meeting, and, as things turned out, the meeting<br/>was to remain in session all day long.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Still, all this was preparatory. Actual requests, in specific amounts, had to be made by the head of<br/>one central bank of the head of another. At the time Coombs was making his softening-up calls, the<br/>head of the Federal Reserve Bank was in the bank’s limousine, somewhere between New Canaan and<br/>Liberty Street, and the bank’s limousine, in flagrant nonconformity with the James Bond style of high-<br/>level international dealings, was not equipped with a telephone.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HAYES, <span class="p">the man being awaited, had been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a<br/>little over eight years, having been chosen for the job, to his own and almost everyone else’s<br/>bewilderment, not from some position of comparable eminence or from the Federal Reserve’s own<br/>ranks but from among the swarming legions of New York commercial-bank vice-presidents.<br/>Unorthodox as the appointment seemed at the time, in retrospect it seems providential. A study of<br/>Hayes’ early life and youthful career gives the impression that everything was somehow intended to<br/>prepare him for dealing with this sort of international monetary crisis, just as the life of a writer or a<br/>painter sometimes seems to have consisted primarily of preparation for the execution of a single work<br/>of art. If Divine Providence, or perhaps its financial department, when the huge sterling crisis was<br/>imminent, had needed an assessment of Hayes’ qualifications for coping with this task and had hired<br/>the celestial equivalent of an executive recruiter to report on him, the dossier might have read<br/>something like this:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Born in Ithaca, New York, on July 4, 1910; grew up mostly in New York City. Father a professor</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>of Constitutional law at Cornell, later a Manhattan investment counsellor; mother a former<br/>schoolteacher, enthusiastic suffragette, settlement-house worker, and political liberal. Both parents<br/>birdwatchers. Family atmosphere intellectual, freethinking, and public-spirited. Attended private<br/>schools   in New York City and Massachusetts and was usually his school’s top-ranking student. Then<br/>went to Harvard (freshman year only) </span><i>and </i><span>Yale (three years: mathematics major, Phi Beta Kappa in<br/>junior year, ineffectual oar on class crew, graduated 1930 as top B.A. of class). Studied at New<br/>College, Oxford, as Rhodes Scholar 1931–33; there became firm Anglophile, and wrote thesis on<br/>‘Federal Reserve Policy and the Working of the Gold Standard in the Years 1923–30,’ although he<br/>had no thought of ever joining the Federal Reserve. Wishes now he had the thesis, in case it contains<br/>blinding youthful illuminations, but neither he nor New College can find it. Entered New York<br/>commercial banking in 1933, and rose slowly but steadily (1938 annual salary twenty-seven hundred<br/>dollars). Attained title (albeit feeble title) of assistant secretary at New York Trust Company in 1942;<br/>after a Navy stint, in 1947 became an assistant vice-president and two years later head of New York<br/>Trust’s foreign department despite total lack of previous experience in foreign banking. Apparently<br/>learned fast; astounded his colleagues and superiors, and gained reputation among them as foreign-<br/>exchange wizard by predicting precise amount of 1949 pound devaluation ($4.03 to $2.80) a few<br/>weeks before it occurred.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“Was appointed president of Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1956, to his utter astonishment<br/>and that of New York banking community, most of which had never heard of this rather shy man.<br/>Reacted calmly by taking his family on a two-month vacation in Europe.

Is liked by European central bankers, who call him Al (which often<br/>comes out sounding more like All). Earns seventy-five thousand dollars a year, making him the<br/>second-highest-paid federal official after the President of the United States, Federal Reserve Bank<br/>salaries being intended to be more or less competitive in banking terms rather than in government-<br/>employee terms.

Tries to observe regular commuting hours and keep his<br/>private life sacrosanct, as a matter of principle; considers regular evening work at an office<br/>‘outrageous.’ Complains that his son has a low opinion of business; attributes this to ‘reverse<br/>snobbery’—but even then remains calm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>“Conclusion: this is the very man for the job of representing the United States’ central bank in a<br/>sterling crisis.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>And, indeed, Hayes readily fits the picture of a perfectly planned and perfectly tooled piece of<br/>machinery to perform a certain complex task, but there are other sides to him, and his character<br/>contains as many paradoxes as the next man’s. Although hardly anyone in banking ever tries to<br/>describe Hayes without using the words “scholarly” and “intellectual,” Hayes tends to think of<br/>himself as an indifferent scholar and intellectual but an effective man of action, and on the latter score<br/>the events of November 25, 1964, seem to bear him out. Although in some ways he is the complete<br/>banker—in conformity with H. G. Wells’ notion of such a banker, he seems to “take money for<br/>granted as a terrier takes rats,” and to be devoid of philosophical curiosity about it—he has a<br/>distinctly unbankerlike philosophical curiosity about almost everything else. And although casual<br/>acquaintances sometimes pronounce him dull, his close friends speak of a rare capacity for enjoyment<br/>and an inner serenity that seem to make him immune to the tensions and distractions that fragment the<br/>lives of so many of his contemporaries. Doubtless the inner serenity was put to a severe test as Hayes<br/>rode in the bank car toward Liberty Street. When he arrived at his desk at about five-thirty, Hayes’</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>first act was to punch Coombs’ button on his interoffice phone and get the foreign-department chief’s<br/>latest appraisal of the situation. He learned that, as he had expected, the Bank of England’s sickening<br/>dollar drain was continuing unabated. Worse than that, though; Coombs said his contacts with local<br/>bankers who were also on emergency early-morning vigil (men in the foreign departments of the huge<br/>commercial banks like the Chase Manhattan and the First National City) indicated that overnight there<br/>had accumulated a fantastic pile of orders to unload pounds on the New York market as soon as it<br/>opened. The Bank of England, already almost inundated, could expect a new tidal wave from New<br/>York to hit in four hours. The need for haste thus became even more urgent. Hayes and Coombs<br/>agreed that the project of putting together an international package of credits to Britain should be<br/>announced as soon as possible after the New York opening—perhaps as early as ten o’clock. So that<br/>the bank would have a single center for all its foreign communications, Hayes decided to forsake his<br/>own office—a spacious one with panelled walls and comfortable chairs grouped around a fireplace</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—and let Coombs’ quarters, down the hall, which were much smaller and more austere but more<br/>efficiently arranged, serve as the command post. Once there, he picked up one of three telephones and<br/>asked the operator to get him Lord Cromer, at the Bank of England. When the connection was made,<br/>the two men—the key figures in the proposed rescue operation—reviewed their plans a final time,<br/>checking the sums they had tentatively decided to ask of each central bank and agreeing on who would<br/>call whom first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark387"><span>In the eyes of some people, Hayes and Lord Cromer make an oddly assorted pair. Besides being a<br/>deep-dyed aristocrat, George Rowland Stanley Baring, third Earl of Cromer, is a deep-dyed banker.<br/>A scion of the famous London merchant bank of Baring Brothers, the third Earl and godson of a<br/>monarch went to Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and spent twelve years as a managing director<br/>of his family’s bank and then two years—from 1959 to 1961—as Britain’s economic minister and<br/>chief representative of his country’s Treasury in Washington. If Hayes had acquired his mastery of the<br/>arcana of international banking by patient study, Lord Cromer, who is no scholar, acquired his by<br/>heredity, instinct, or osmosis. If Hayes, despite his unusual physical stature, could easily be<br/>overlooked in a crowd, Lord Cromer, who is of average height but debonair and dashing, would cut a<br/>figure anywhere. If Hayes is inclined to be a bit hesitant about casual intimacies, Lord Cromer is<br/>known for his hearty manner, and has—doubtless unintentionally—both flattered and obscurely<br/>disappointed many American bankers who have been awed by his title by quickly encouraging them<br/>to call him Rowley. “Rowley is very self-confident and decisive,” an American banker has said.<br/>“He’s never afraid to barge in, because he’s convinced of the reasonableness of his own position. But<br/>then he’s a reasonable man. He’s the kind of man who in a crisis would be able to grab the telephone<br/>and do something about it.” This banker confesses that until November 25, 1964, he had not thought<br/>Hayes was that kind of man.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark388"><span>Beginning at about six o’clock that morning, Hayes did grab the phone, right along with Lord<br/>Cromer. One after another, the leading central bankers of the world—among them President Karl<br/>Blessing, of the Deutsche Bundesbank; Dr. Guido Carli, of the Bank of Italy; Governor Jacques<br/>Brunet, of the Bank of France; Dr. Walter Schwegler, of the Swiss National Bank; and Governor Per<br/>Åsbrink, of the Swedish Riksbank—picked up </span></a><i>their </i><span>phones and discovered, some of them with<br/>considerable surprise, the degree of gravity that the sterling crisis had reached in the past day, the fact<br/>that the United States had committed itself to a short-term loan of one billion dollars, and that they<br/>were being asked to dig deep into their own nations’ reserves to help tide sterling over. Some first<br/>heard all this from Hayes, some from Lord Cromer; in either case, they heard it not from a casual or<br/>official acquaintance but from a fellow-member of that esoteric fraternity the Basel club. Hayes,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>whose position as representative of the one country that had already pledged a huge sum cast him<br/>almost automatically as the leader of the operation, was careful to make it clear in each of his calls<br/>that his part in the proceedings was to put the weight of the Federal Reserve behind a request that<br/>formally came from the Bank of England. “The pound’s situation is critical, and I understand the Bank<br/>of England is requesting a credit line of two hundred and fifty million dollars from you,” he would<br/>say, in his calm way, to one Continental central-bank governor or another. “I’m sure you understand<br/>that this is a situation where we all have to stand together.” (He and Coombs always spoke English,<br/>of course. Despite the fact that he had recently been taking French refresher lessons, and that at Yale<br/>he made one of the most impressive academic records in memory, Hayes doggedly remained a dub at<br/>languages and still did not trust himself to carry on an important business conversation in anything but<br/>English.) In those cases in which he was on particularly close terms with his Continental counterpart,<br/>he spoke more informally, using a central-bankers’ jargon in which the conventional numerical unit is<br/>a million dollars. Hayes would say smoothly in such cases, “Do you think you can come in for, say, a<br/>hundred and fifty?” Regardless of the degree of formality of the approach Hayes made, the first<br/>response, he says, was generally cageyness, not unmixed with shock. “Is it really as bad as all that,<br/>Al? We were still hoping that the pound would recover on its own” is the kind of thing he recalls<br/>having heard several times. When Hayes assured them that it was indeed as bad as all that, and that<br/>the pound would certainly not recover on its own, the usual response was something like “We’ll have<br/>to see what we can do and then call you back.” Some of the Continental central bankers have said that<br/>what impressed them most about Hayes’ first call was not so much what he said as when he said it.<br/>Realizing that it was still well before dawn in New York, and knowing Hayes’ addiction to what are<br/>commonly thought of as bankers’ hours, these Europeans perceived that things must be grave the<br/>moment they heard his voice. As soon as Hayes had broken the ice at each Continental bank, Coombs<br/>would take over and get down to details with his counterparts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark389"><span>The first round of calls left Hayes, Lord Cromer, and their associates on Liberty and Threadneedle<br/>Streets relatively hopeful. Not one bank had given them a flat no—not even, to their delight, the Bank<br/>of France, although French policy had already begun moving sharply away from coöperation with<br/>Britain and the United States in monetary matters, among others. Furthermore, several governors had<br/>surprised them by suggesting that their countries’ subscriptions to the loan might actually be bigger<br/>than those suggested. With this encouragement, Hayes and Lord Cromer decided to raise their sights.<br/>They had originally been aiming for credits of two and a half billion dollars; now, on<br/>reconsideration,they saw that there was a chance for three billion. “We decided to up the ante a little<br/>here and there,” Hayes says. “There was no way of knowing precisely what sum would be the least<br/>that would do the job of turning the tide. We knew we would be relying to a large extent on the<br/>psychological effect of our announcement—assuming we would be able to make the announcement.<br/>Three seemed to us a good, round figure.”</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>But difficulties lay ahead, and the biggest difficulty, it became clear as the return calls from the<br/>various banks began to come in, was to get the thing done quickly. The hardest point to convey, Hayes<br/>and Coombs found, was that each passing minute meant a further loss of a million dollars or more to<br/>the British reserves, and that if normal channels were followed the loans would unquestionably come<br/>too late to avert devaluation of the pound. Some of the central banks were required by law to consult<br/>their governments before making a commitment and some were not, but even those that were not<br/>insisted on doing so, as a courtesy; this took time, especially since more than one Finance Minister,<br/>unaware that he was being sought to approve an enormous loan on an instant’s notice, with little<br/>evidence of the necessity for it beyond the assurance of Lord Cromer and Hayes, was temporarily</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark390"><span>unavailable. (One happened to be engaged in debate in his country’s parliament.) And even in cases<br/>where the Finance Minister was at hand, he was sometimes reluctant to act in such a shotgun way.<br/>Governments move more deliberately in money matters than central bankers do. Some of the Finance<br/>Ministers said, in effect, that upon proper submission of a balance sheet of the Bank of England, along<br/>with a formal written application for the emergency credit, they would gladly consider the matter.<br/>Furthermore, some of the central banks themselves showed a maddening inclination to stand on<br/>ceremony. The foreign-exchange chief of one bank is said to have replied to the request by saying,<br/>“Well, isn’t this convenient! We happen to have a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow. We’ll take<br/>the matter up then, and afterward we’ll get in touch with you.” The reply of Coombs, who happened<br/>to be the man on the wire in New York, is not recorded in substance, but its manner is reported to<br/>have been uncharacteristically vehement. Even Hayes’ celebrated imperturbability was shaken a time<br/>or two, or so those who were present have said; his tone remained as calm and even as ever, but its<br/>volume rose far above the usual level.</span></a><a name="bookmark391">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark392"><span>The problems that the Continental central banks faced in meeting the challenge are well<br/>exemplified by the situation at the richest and most powerful of them, the Deutsche Bundesbank. Its<br/>board of managers was already sitting in emergency session as a result of Coombs’ early call when<br/>another New York call—this one from Hayes to President Blessing—gave the Bundesbank its first<br/>indication of exactly how much it was being asked to put up. The amounts the various central banks<br/>were asked for that morning have never been made public, but, on the basis of what </span></a><i>has </i><span>become<br/>known, it is reasonable to assume that the Bundesbank was asked for half a billion dollars—the<br/>highest quota of the lot, and certainly the largest sum that any central bank other than the Federal<br/>Reserve had ever been called upon to supply to another on a few hours’ notice. Hard on the heels of<br/>Hayes’ call conveying this jarring information, Blessing heard from Lord Cromer, in London, who<br/>confirmed everything that Hayes had said about the seriousness of the crisis and repeated the request.<br/>Wincing a bit, perhaps, the Bundesbank managers agreed in principle that the thing had to be done.<br/>But right there their problems began. Proper procedure must be adhered to, Blessing and his aides<br/>decided. Before taking any action, they must consult with their economic partners in the European<br/>Common Market and the Bank for International Settlements, and the key man to be consulted, since he<br/>was then serving as president of the Bank for International Settlements, was Dr. Marius W. Holtrop,<br/>governor of the Bank of the Netherlands, which, of course, was also being asked to contribute. A rush<br/>person-to-person call was put through from Frankfurt to Amsterdam. Dr. Holtrop, the Bundesbank<br/>managers were informed, wasn’t in Amsterdam; by chance, he had taken a train that morning to The<br/>Hague to meet his country’s Finance Minister for consultation on other matters. For the Bank of the<br/>Netherlands to make any such important commitment without the knowledge of its governor was out<br/>of the question, and, similarly, the Bank of Belgium, a nation whose monetary policies are linked<br/>inextricably with the Netherlands’, was reluctant to act until Amsterdam had given its O.K. So for an<br/>hour or more, as millions of dollars continued to drain out of the Bank of England and the world<br/>monetary order stood in jeopardy, the whole rescue operation was hung up while Dr. Holtrop,<br/>crossing the Dutch lowlands by train, or perhaps already in The Hague and tied up in a traffic jam,<br/>could not be found.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ALL <span class="p">this, of course, meant agonizing frustration in New York. As morning began here at last, Hayes’<br/>and Coombs’ campaign got a boost from Washington. The leading government monetary authorities—<br/>Martin at the Federal Reserve Board, Dillon and Roosa at the Treasury—had all been intimately<br/>involved in the previous day’s planning for the rescue, and of course part of the planning had been the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>decision to let the New York bank, as the Federal Reserve System’s and the Treasury’s normal<br/>operating arm in international monetary dealings, serve as campaign headquarters. So the members of<br/>the Washington contingent had slept at home and come to their offices at the normal hour. Now,<br/>having learned from Hayes of the difficulties that were developing, Martin, Dillon, and Roosa pitched<br/>in with transatlantic calls of their own to emphasize the extent of America’s concern over the matter.<br/>But no number of calls from anywhere could hold back the clock—or, for that matter, find Dr.<br/>Holtrop—and Hayes and Coombs finally had to abandon their idea of having a credit bundle ready in<br/>time        for an announcement to the world at or near 10 </span><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>in New York. And there were other reasons,<br/>too, for a fading of the early hopes. As the New York markets opened, the extent of the alarm that had<br/>spread around the financial world overnight was only too clearly revealed. The bank’s foreign-<br/>exchange trading desk, on the seventh floor, reported that the assault on the pound at the New York<br/>opening had been fully as terrifying as they had expected, and that the atmosphere in the local<br/>exchange market had reached a state not far from panic. From the bank’s securities department came<br/>an alarming report that the market for United States government bonds was coming under the heaviest<br/>pressure in years, reflecting an ominous lack of confidence in the dollar on the part of bond traders.<br/>This intelligence served as a grim reminder to Hayes and Coombs of something they knew already—<br/>that a fall of the pound in relation to the dollar could quite possibly be followed, in a kind of chain<br/>reaction, by a forced devaluation of the dollar in relation to gold, which might cause monetary chaos<br/>everywhere. If Hayes and Coombs had been permitting themselves any moments of idle reverie in<br/>which     to picture themselves simply as good Samaritans, this was just the news to bring them back to<br/>reality. And then word arrived that the wild tales flying around Wall Street showed signs of<br/>crystallizing into a single tale, demoralizingly credible because it was so specific. The British<br/>government, it was being said, would announce a sterling devaluation at around noon New York time.<br/>Here was something that could be authoritatively refuted, at least in respect to timing, since Britain<br/>would obviously not devalue while the credit negotiations were under way. Torn between the desire<br/>to quell a destructive rumor and the need to keep the negotiations secret until they were concluded,<br/>Hayes compromised. He had one of his associates call a few key Wall Street bankers and traders to<br/>say, as emphatically as possible, that the latest devaluation rumor was, to his firm knowledge, false.<br/>“Can you be more specific?” the associate was asked, and he replied, because there was nothing else<br/>he could reply, “No, I can’t.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark393"><span>This unsupported word was something, but it was not enough; the foreign-exchange and bond<br/>markets were only momentarily reassured. There were times that morning, Hayes and Coombs now<br/>admit, when they put down their telephones, looked at each other across the table in Coombs’ office,<br/>and wordlessly exchanged the thought: It isn’t going to be done in time. But—in the best tradition of<br/>melodrama, which sometimes seems to survive stubbornly in nature at a time when it is dead in art—<br/>just when things looked darkest, good news began to arrive. Dr. Holtrop had been tracked down in a<br/>restaurant in The Hague, where he was having lunch with the Netherlands’ Minister of Finance, Dr. J.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>W. Witteveen; moreover, Dr. Holtrop had endorsed the rescue operation, and as for the matter of<br/>consulting his government, </span><i>that </i><span>was no problem, since the responsible representative of his<br/>government was sitting across the table from him. The chief obstacle was thus overcome, and after<br/>Dr. Holtrop had been reached the difficulties began narrowing down to annoyances like the necessity<br/>for continually apologizing to the Japanese for routing them out of bed as midnight arrived and passed<br/>in Tokyo. The tide had turned. Before noon in New York, Hayes and Coombs, and Lord Cromer and<br/>his deputies in London as well, knew that they had agreement in principle from ten Continental central<br/>banks—those in West Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sweden, Austria, and Japan—and also from the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark394"><span>There remained the wait while each central bank went through the painfully slow process of<br/>completing whatever formalities were required to make its action legal and proper. The epitome of<br/>orderliness, the Bundesbank, could not act until it had obtained ratification from the members of its<br/>board of directors, most of whom were in provincial outposts scattered around Germany. The two<br/>leading Bundesbank deputies divided up the job of calling the absent directors and persuading them to<br/>go along—a job that was made more delicate by the fact that the absent directors were being asked to<br/>approve something that, in effect, the bank’s home office had already undertaken to do. At<br/>midafternoon by Continental time, while the two deputies were busy at this exercise in doubletalk,<br/>Frankfurt got a new call from London. It was Lord Cromer, no doubt sounding as exasperated as his<br/>situation permitted, and what he had to say was that the rate of British reserve loss had become so<br/>rapid that the pound could not survive another day. Formalities notwithstanding, it was a case of now<br/>or never. (The Bank of England’s reserve loss that day has never been announced. The </span></a><i>Economist</i><span>later passed along a guess that it may have run to five hundred million dollars, or about a quarter of<br/>all that remained in Britain’s reserve coffers.) After Lord Cromer’s call, the Bundesbank deputies<br/>tempered their tact with brevity; they got unanimous approval from the directors, and shortly after five<br/>o’clock Frankfurt time they were ready to tell Lord Cromer and Hayes that the Bundesbank was in for<br/>the requested half-billion dollars.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Other central banks were coming in, or were already in. Canada and Italy put up two hundred<br/>million dollars each, and doubtless were glad to do it, inasmuch as their own currencies had been the<br/>beneficiaries of much smaller but otherwise similar international bailout operations in 1962 and<br/>earlier in 1964, respectively. If a subsequent report in the London </span><i>Times </i><span>is to be accepted, France,<br/>Belgium, and the Netherlands, no one of which ever announced the amount of its participation, each<br/>contributed two hundred million dollars, too. Switzerland is known to have come through with a<br/>hundred and sixty million dollars and Sweden with a hundred million dollars, while Austria, Japan,<br/>and the Bank for International Settlements rounded out the bundle with still undisclosed amounts. By<br/>lunchtime in New York, it was all over but the shouting, and the last part of the task was to make the<br/>shouting as effective as possible to give it the fastest and most forcible impact on the market.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The task brought to the fore another Federal Reserve Bank man, its vice-president in charge of<br/>public information, Thomas Olaf Waage. Waage (his name rhymes with “saga”) had been present and<br/>active in Coombs’ office almost all morning, constantly on the phone as liaison man with Washington.<br/>A born-and-bred New Yorker, the son of a Norwegian-born local tug pilot and fishing-boat captain,<br/>Waage is a man of broad and unfeigned outside interests—among them opera, Shakespeare, Trollope,<br/>and his ancestral heritage, sailing—and one consuming passion, which is striving to convey not only<br/>the facts but also the drama, suspense, and excitement of central banking to a skeptical and often<br/>glassy-eyed public. In short, a banker who is a hopeless romantic. So now he was overjoyed when<br/>Hayes assigned to him the job of  preparing a news release that would inform the world, as<br/>emphatically as possible, about the rescue operation. While Hayes and Coombs struggled to tie up the<br/>loose ends of their package, Waage was busy coördinating timing with his counterparts at the Federal<br/>Reserve Board and the Treasury Department in Washington, which would share in the issuing of the<br/>American announcement, and at the Bank of England, which, Hayes and Lord Cromer had agreed,<br/>would issue a simultaneous announcement of its own. “Two o’clock in the afternoon New York time<br/>was the hour we agreed upon for the announcements, when it began to look as if we’d have something<br/>to announce by that time,” Waage recalls. “That was too late to catch the Continental and London<br/>markets that day, of course, but it left the whole afternoon ahead until the New York markets closed,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>at around five, and if the sterling market could be dramatically reversed here before closing time,<br/>chances were the recovery would continue on the Continent and in London next day, when the<br/>American markets would be closed for Thanksgiving. As for the amount of the combined credit we<br/>were planning to announce, it still stood at three billion dollars. But I remember that a last-minute<br/>snag of a particularly embarrassing sort developed. Very late in the game, when we thought the whole<br/>package was in hand, Charlie Coombs and I counted up what had been pledged, just to make sure, and<br/>we got only two billion eight hundred and fifty million. Apparently, we’d mislaid a hundred and fifty<br/>million dollars somewhere. That’s just what we’d done—we’d miscalculated. So it was all right.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The package was assembled in time to meet the new schedule, and statements from the Federal<br/>Reserve, the Treasury, and the Bank of England duly went out to the news media simultaneously, at 2</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark395">P.M. </a><span class="p">in New York and 7 </span>P.M. <span class="p">in London. As a result of Waage’s influence, the American version,<br/>though it fell somewhat short of the mood of, say, the last scene of “Die Meistersinger,” was<br/>nevertheless exceptionally stirring as bank utterances go, speaking with a certain subdued<br/>flamboyance of the unprecedented nature of the sum involved and of how the central banks had<br/>“moved quickly to mobilize a massive counterattack on speculative selling of the pound.” The London<br/>release had a different kind of distinction, achieving something of the quintessential Britishness that<br/>seems to be reserved for moments of high crisis. It read simply, “The Bank of England have made<br/>arrangements under which $3,000M. are made available for the support of sterling.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">APPARENTLY, </span><span>the secrecy of the operation had been successfully preserved and the announcement<br/>struck the New York foreign-exchange market all of a heap, because the reaction was as swift and as<br/>electric as anyone could have wished. Speculators against the pound decided instantly and with no<br/>hesitation that their game was up. Immediately after the announcement, the Federal Reserve Bank put<br/>in a bid for pounds at $2.7868—a figure slightly above the level at which the pound had been forcibly<br/>maintained all day by the Bank of England. So great was the rush of speculators to get free of their<br/>speculative positions by buying pounds that the Federal Reserve Bank found very few pounds for sale<br/>at that price. Around two-fifteen, there were a strange and heartening few minutes in which no sterling<br/>was available in New York at </span><i>any </i><span>price. Pounds were eventually offered for sale again at a higher<br/>price, and were immediately gobbled up, and thus the price went on climbing all afternoon, to a<br/>closing of just above $2.79.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Triumph! The pound was out of immediate danger; the thing had worked. Tributes to the success of<br/>the operation began to pour in from everywhere. Even the magisterial </span><i>Economist </i><span>was to declare<br/>shortly, “Whatever other networks break down, it seems, the central bankers [have an] astonishing<br/>capacity for instant results. And if theirs is not the most desirable possible mechanism, geared always<br/>to short-term support of the status quo, it happens to be the only working one.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark396"><span>So, with the pound riding reasonably high again, the Federal Reserve Bank shut up for<br/>Thanksgiving, and the bankers went home. Coombs recalls having drunk a Martini unaccustomedly<br/>fast. Hayes, home in New Canaan, found that his son, Tom, had arrived from Harvard. Both his wife<br/>and his son noticed that he seemed to be in an unusual state of excitement, and when they asked about<br/>it he replied that he had just been through the most completely satisfying day of his entire working<br/>career. Pressed for details, he gave them a condensed and simplified account of the rescue operation,<br/>keeping constantly in mind the fact that his audience consisted of a wife who had no interest in<br/>banking and a son who had a low opinion of business. The reaction he got when his recital was<br/>concluded was of a sort that might warm the heart of a Waage, or of any earnest explicator of banking<br/>derring-do to the unsympathetic layman. “It was a little confusing at first,” Mrs. Hayes has said, “but</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">before you were finished you had us on the edge of our chairs.”</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Waage, home in Douglaston, told <i>his </i>wife of the day’s events in <i>his </i>characteristic way. “It was St.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Crispin’s Day,” he exclaimed as he burst through his doorway, “and I was with Harry!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">III</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HAVING <span class="p">first become interested in the pound and its perils at the time of the 1964 crisis, I found<br/>myself hooked by the subject. Through the subsequent three and a half years, I followed its ups and<br/>downs in the American and British press, and at intervals went down to the Federal Reserve Bank to<br/>renew my acquaintance with its officers and see what additional enlightenment I could garner. The<br/>whole experience was a resounding vindication of Waage’s thesis that central banking can be<br/>suspenseful.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The pound wouldn’t stay saved. A month after the big 1964 crisis, the speculators resumed their<br/>assaults, and by the end of that year the Bank of England had used up more than half a billion of its<br/>new three-billion-dollar credit. Nor did the coming of the new year bring surcease. In 1965, after a<br/>relatively buoyant January, the pound came under pressure again in February. The November credit<br/>had been for a term of three months; now, as the term ran out, the nations that had made it decided to<br/>extend it for another three months, so that Britain would have more time to put its economy in order.<br/>But late in March the British economy was still shaky, the pound was back below $2.79, and the Bank<br/>of England was back in the market. In April, Britain announced a tougher budget, and a rally<br/>followed, but the rally proved to be short-lived. By early summer, the Bank of England had drawn,<br/>and committed to the battle against the speculators, more than a third of the whole three billion.<br/>Heartened, the speculators pressed their attack. Late in June, high British officials, let it be known<br/>that they now considered the sterling crisis over, but they were whistling in the dark; in July the pound<br/>sank again, despite further belt-tightening in the British domestic economy. By the end of July, the<br/>world foreign-exchange market had become convinced that a new crisis was shaping up. By late<br/>August, the crisis had arrived, and in some ways it was a more dangerous one than that of the<br/>previous November. The trouble was the market seemed to believe that the central banks were tired<br/>of pouring money into the battle and would now let sterling fall, regardless of the consequences.<br/>About that time, I telephoned a leading local foreign-exchange man I know to ask him what he thought<br/>of the situation, and he replied, “To my knowledge, the New York market is one hundred per cent<br/>convinced that devaluation of sterling is coming this fall—and I don’t mean ninety-five per cent, I<br/>mean one hundred per cent.” Then, on September 11th, I read in the papers that the same group of<br/>central banks, this time with the exception of France, had come through with another last-minute<br/>rescue package, the amount not being announced at the time—it was subsequently reported to have<br/>been around one billion—and over the next few days I watched the market price of the pound rise,<br/>little by little, until by the end of the month it was above $2.80 for the first time in sixteen months.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The central banks had done it again, and somewhat later I went down to the Federal Reserve Bank<br/>to learn the details. It was Coombs I saw, and I found him in a sanguine and extraordinarily talkative<br/>mood. “This year’s operation was entirely different from last year’s,” he told me. “It was an<br/>aggressive move on our part, rather than a last-ditch-defensive one. You see, early this September we<br/>came to the conclusion that the pound was grossly oversold—that is, the amount of speculation<br/>against it was way out of proportion to what was justified by the economic facts. Actually, during the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>first eight months of the year, British exports had risen more than five per cent over the corresponding<br/>period in 1964, and Britain’s 1964 balance-of-payments deficit seemed likely to be cut in half in<br/>1965. Very promising economic progress, and the bearish speculators seemed not to have taken<br/>account of it. They had gone right on selling the pound short, on the basis of technical market factors.<br/>They were the ones who were in an exposed position now. We decided the time was ripe for an<br/>official counterattack.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The counterattack, Coombs went on to explain, was plotted in leisurely fashion this time—not on<br/>the telephone but face to face, over the weekend of September 5th in Basel. The Federal Reserve<br/>Bank was represented by Coombs, as usual, and also by Hayes, who cut short his long-planned<br/>vacation on Corfu to be there. The coup was planned with military precision. It was decided not to<br/>announce the amount of the credit package this time, in order to further confuse and disconcert the<br/>enemy, the speculators. The place chosen for the launching was the trading room of the Federal<br/>Reserve Bank, and the hour chosen was 9 </span><span class="s6">A.M. </span><span>New York time—early enough for London and the<br/>Continent to be still conducting business—on September 10th. At zero hour, the Bank of England fired<br/>a preliminary salvo by announcing that new central-bank arrangements would shortly enable<br/>“appropriate action” to be taken in the exchange markets. After allowing fifteen minutes for the import<br/>of this demurely menacing message to sink in, the Federal Reserve Bank struck. Using, with British<br/>concurrence, the new bundle of international credit as its ammunition, it simultaneously placed with<br/>all the major banks operating in the New York exchange market bids for sterling totalling nearly thirty<br/>million dollars, at the then prevailing rate of $2.7918. Under this pressure, the market immediately<br/>moved upward, and the Federal Reserve Bank pursued the movement, raising its bid price step by<br/>step. At $2.7934, the bank temporarily ceased operations—partly to see what the market would do on<br/>its own, partly just to confuse things. The market held steady, showing that at that level there were<br/>now as many independent buyers of sterling as there were sellers, and that the bears—speculators—<br/>were losing their nerve. But the bank was far from satisfied; returning vigorously to the market, it bid<br/>the price on up to $2.7945 in the course of the day. And then the snowball began to roll by itself—<br/>with the results I had read about in my newspapers. “It was a successful bear squeeze,” Coombs told<br/>me with a certain grim relish, which was easy to sympathize with; I found myself musing that for a<br/>banker to rout his opponents, to smite them hip and thigh and drive them to cover, and not for personal<br/>or institutional profit but, rather, for the public good, must be a source of rare, unalloyed satisfaction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>I later learned from another banker just how painfully the bears had been squeezed. Margins of<br/>credit on currency speculation being what they are—for example, to commit a million dollars against<br/>the pound a speculator might need to put up only thirty or forty thousand dollars in cash—most<br/>dealers had made commitments running into the tens of millions. When a dealer’s commitment was ten<br/>million pounds, or twenty-eight million dollars, each change of one-hundredth of a cent in the price of<br/>the pound meant a change of a thousand dollars in the value of his account. Between the $2.7918 on<br/>September 10th, then, and the $2.8010 that the pound reached on September 29th, such a dealer on the<br/>short side of the pound would have lost ninety-two thousand dollars—enough, one might suppose, to<br/>make him think twice before selling sterling short again.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark397"><span>An extended period of calm followed. The air of impending crisis that had hung over the exchanges<br/>during most of the preceding year disappeared, and for more than six months the world sterling<br/>market was sunnier than it had been at any time in recent years. “The battle for the pound sterling is<br/>now ended,” high British officials (anonymous, and wisely so) announced in November, on the first<br/>anniversary of the 1964 rescue. Now, the officials said, “we’re fighting the battle for the economy.”<br/>Apparently, they were winning that battle, too, because when Britain’s balance-of-payments position</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>for 1965 was finally calculated, it showed that the deficit had been not merely halved, according to<br/>predictions, but </span><i>more </i><span>than halved. And meanwhile the pound’s strength enabled the Bank of England<br/>not merely to pay off all its short-term debts to other central banks but also to accumulate in the open<br/>market, in exchange for its newly desirable pounds, more than a billion fresh dollars to add to its<br/>precious reserves. Thus, between September, 1965, and March, 1966, those reserves rose from two<br/>billion six hundred million dollars to three billion six hundred million—a fairly safe figure. And then<br/>the pound breezed nicely through a national election campaign—as always, a stormy time for the<br/>currency. When I saw Coombs in the spring of 1966, he seemed as cocky and blasé about sterling as<br/>an old-time New York Yankee rooter about his team.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark398"><span>I had all but concluded that following the fortunes of the pound was no longer any fun when a new<br/>crisis exploded. A seamen’s strike contributed to a recurrence of Britain’s trade deficit, and in early<br/>June of 1966 the quotation was back below $2.79 and the Bank of England was reported to be back in<br/>the market spending its reserves on the defense. On June 13th, with something of the insouciance of<br/>veteran  firemen responding to a routine call, back came the central banks with a new bundle of short-<br/>term credits. But these helped only temporarily, and toward the end of July, in an effort to get at the<br/>root of the pound’s troubles by curing the deficit once and for all, Prime Minister Wilson imposed on<br/>the British people the most stringent set of economic restraints ever applied in his country in<br/>peacetime—high taxes, a merciless squeeze on credit, a freeze on wages and prices, a cut in<br/>government welfare spending, and a limit of a hundred and forty dollars on the annual amount that<br/>each Briton could spend on travel abroad. The Federal Reserve, Coombs told me later, helped by<br/>moving into the sterling market immediately after the British announcement of the austerity program,<br/>and the pound reacted satisfactorily to this prodding. In September, for good measure, the Federal<br/>Reserve increased its swap line with the Bank of England from seven hundred and fifty million to one<br/>billion three hundred and fifty million dollars. I saw Waage in September, and he spoke warmly of all<br/>the dollars that the Bank of England was again accumulating. “Sterling crises have become a bore,”<br/>the </span></a><i>Economist </i>remarked at about this time, with the most reassuring sort of British phlegm.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Calm again—and again for just a little more than six months. In April of 1967, Britain was free of<br/>short-term debt and had ample reserves. But within a month or so came the first of a series of<br/>heartbreaking setbacks. Two consequences of the brief Arab-Israeli war—a huge flow of Arab funds<br/>out of sterling into other currencies, and the closing of the Suez Canal, one of Britain’s main trade<br/>arteries—brought on a new crisis almost overnight. In June, the Bank of England (under new<br/>leadership now, for in 1966 Lord Cromer had been succeeded as governor by Sir Leslie O’Brien)<br/>had to draw heavily on its swap line with the Federal Reserve, and in July the British government<br/>found itself forced to renew the painful economic restraints of the previous year; even so, in<br/>September the pound slipped down to $2.7830, its lowest point since the 1964 crisis. I called my<br/>foreign-exchange expert to ask why the Bank of England—which in November, 1964, had set its last-<br/>line trench at $2.7860, and which, according to its latest statement, now had on hand reserves<br/>amounting to more than two and a half billion dollars—was letting the price slide so dangerously<br/>near the absolute bottom (short of devaluation) of $2.78. “Well, the situation isn’t quite as desperate<br/>as the figure suggests,” he replied. “The speculative pressure so far isn’t anything like as strong as it<br/>was in 1964. And the fundamental economic position this year—up to now, at least—is much better.<br/>Despite the Middle East war, the austerity program has taken hold. For the first eight months of 1967,<br/>Britain’s international payments have been nearly in balance. The Bank of England is evidently<br/>hoping that this period of weakness of the pound will pass without its intervention.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At about that time, however, I became aware of a disturbing portent in the air—the apparent</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark399"><span>abandonment by the British of their long-standing taboo against bandying about the word<br/>“devaluation.” Like other taboos, this one seemed to have been based on a combination of practical<br/>logic (talk about devaluation could easily start a speculative stampede and thereby bring it on) and<br/>superstition. But now I found devaluation being freely and frequently discussed in the British press,<br/>and, in several respected journals, actually advocated. Nor was that all. Prime Minister Wilson, it is<br/>true, continued to follow a careful path around the word, even in the very act of pledging, as he did<br/>over and over, that his government would abstain from the deed; there would be “no change in<br/>existing policy” as to “overseas monetary matters,” he said, delicately, on one occasion. On July<br/>24th, though, Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan spoke openly in the House of Commons<br/>about devaluation, complaining that advocacy of it as a national policy had become fashionable,<br/>declaring that such a policy would represent a breach of faith with other nations and their people and<br/>also pledging that  his government  would never resort to it. His sentiments were familiar and<br/>reassuring; his straightforward expression of them was just the opposite. In the darkest days of 1964,<br/>no one had said “devaluation” in Parliament.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark400"><span>All through the autumn, I had a feeling that Britain was being overtaken by a fiendish concatenation<br/>of cruel mischances, some specifically damaging to the pound and others merely crushing to British<br/>morale. The previous spring, oil from a wrecked, and wretched, tanker had defiled the beaches of<br/>Cornwall; now an epidemic was destroying tens, and ultimately hundreds, of thousands of head of<br/>cattle. The economic straitjacket that Britain had worn for more than a year had swelled<br/>unemployment to the highest level in years and made the Labour Government the most unpopular<br/>government in the postwar era. (Six months later, in a poll sponsored by the </span></a><i>Sunday Times</i><span>, Britons<br/>would vote Wilson the fourth most villainous man of the century, after Hitler, de Gaulle, and Stalin, in<br/>that order.) A dock strike in London and Liverpool that began in mid-September and was to drag on<br/>for more than two months decreased still further the already hobbled export trade, and put an abrupt<br/>end to Britain’s remaining hope of ending the year with its international accounts in balance. Early in<br/>November, 1967, the pound stood at $2.7822, its lowest point in a decade. And then things went<br/>downhill fast. On the evening of Monday the thirteenth, Wilson took the occasion of his annual<br/>appearance at the Lord Mayor of London’s banquet—the very platform he had used for his fiery<br/>commitment to the defense of sterling in the crisis three years earlier—to implore the country and the<br/>world to disregard, as distorted by temporary factors, his nation’s latest foreign-trade statistics,<br/>which would be released the next day. On Tuesday the fourteenth, Britain’s foreign-trade figures, duly<br/>released, showed an October deficit of over a hundred million pounds—the worst ever reported. The<br/>Cabinet met at lunch on Thursday the sixteenth, and that afternoon, in the House of Commons,<br/>Chancellor Callaghan, upon being asked to confirm or deny rumors of an enormous new central-bank<br/>credit that would be contingent upon still further unemployment-breeding austerity measures, replied<br/>with heat, and with what was later called a lack of discretion, “The Government will take what<br/>decisions are appropriate in the light of our understanding of the needs of the British economy, and no<br/>one else’s. And that, at this stage, does not include the creation of any additional unemployment.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>With one accord, the exchange markets decided that the decision to devalue had been taken and that<br/>Callaghan had inadvertently let the cat out of the bag. Friday the seventeenth was the wildest day in<br/>the history of the exchange markets, and the blackest in the thousand-year history of sterling. In<br/>holding it at $2.7825—the price decided on this time as the last-line trench—the Bank of England<br/>spent a quantity of reserve dollars that it may never see fit to reveal; Wall Street commercial bankers<br/>who have reason to know have estimated the amount at somewhere around a billion dollars, which<br/>would mean a continuous, day-long reserve drain of over two million per minute. Doubtless the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>British reserves dropped below the two-billion-dollar mark, and perhaps far below it. Late on a<br/>Saturday—November 18th—full of confused alarms, Britain announced its capitulation. I heard about<br/>it from Waage, who telephoned me that afternoon at five-thirty New York time. “As of an hour ago,<br/>the pound was devalued to two dollars and forty cents, and the British bank rate went to eight per<br/>cent,” he said. His voice was shaking a little.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ON <span class="p">Saturday night, bearing in mind that scarcely anything but a major war upsets world financial<br/>arrangements more than devaluation of a major currency, I went down to the capital of world finance,<br/>Wall Street, to look around. A nasty wind was whipping papers through empty streets, and there was<br/>the usual rather intimidating off-hours stillness in that part-time city. There was something unusual,<br/>though: the presence of rows of lighted windows in the otherwise dark buildings—for the most part,<br/>one lighted row per building. Some of the rows I could identify as the foreign departments of the big<br/>banks. The heavy doors of the banks were locked and barred; foreign-department men evidently ring<br/>to gain entrance on weekends, or use invisible side or rear entrances. Turning up my coat collar, I<br/>headed up Nassau Street toward Liberty to take a look at the Federal Reserve Bank. I found it lighted<br/>not in a single line but—more hospitably, somehow—in an irregular pattern over its entire Florentine<br/>façade, yet it, too, presented to the street a formidably closed front door. As I looked at it, a gust of<br/>wind brought an incongruous burst of organ music—perhaps from Trinity Church, a few blocks away</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—and I realized that in ten or fifteen minutes I hadn’t seen anyone. The scene seemed to me to<br/>epitomize one of the two faces of central banking—the cold and hostile face, suggesting men in<br/>arrogant secrecy making decisions that affect all the rest of us but that we can neither influence nor<br/>even comprehend, rather than the more congenial face of elegant and learned men of affairs<br/>beneficently saving faltering currencies over their truffles and wine at Basel. This was not the night<br/>for the latter face.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark401"><span>On Sunday afternoon, Waage held a press conference in a room on the tenth floor of the bank, and I<br/>attended it, along with a dozen other reporters, mostly regulars on the Federal Reserve beat. Waage<br/>discoursed generally on the devaluation, parrying questions he didn’t want to answer, sometimes by<br/>replying to them, like the teacher he once was, with questions of his own. It was still far too early, he<br/>said, to tell how great the danger was that the devaluation might lead to “another 1931.” Almost any<br/>prediction, he said, would be a matter of trying to outguess millions of people and thousands of banks<br/>around the world. The next few days would tell the story. Waage seemed stimulated rather than<br/>depressed; his attitude was clearly one of apprehension but also of resolution. On the way out, I asked<br/>him whether he had been up all night. “No, last evening I went to ‘The Birthday Party,’ and I must say<br/>Pinter’s world makes more sense than mine does, these days,” he replied.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>The outlines of what had happened Thursday and Friday began to emerge during the next few days.<br/>Most of the rumors that had been abroad turned out to have been more or less true. Britain </span><i>had </i><span>been<br/>negotiating for another huge credit to forestall devaluation—a credit of the order of magnitude of the<br/>three-billion-dollar 1964 package, with the United States again planning to provide the largest share.<br/>Whether Britain had devalued from choice or necessity remained debatable. Wilson, in explaining the<br/>devaluation to his people in a television address, said that “it would have been possible to ride out<br/>this present tide of foreign speculation against the pound by borrowing from central banks and<br/>governments,” but that such action this time would have been “irresponsible,” because “our creditors<br/>abroad might well insist on guarantees about this or that aspect of our national policies”; he did not<br/>say explicitly that they had done so. In any event, the British Cabinet had—with what grim reluctance<br/>may be imagined—decided in principle on devaluation as early as the previous weekend, and then</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark402"><span>determined the exact amount of the devaluation at its Thursday-noon meeting. At that time, the Cabinet<br/>had also resolved to help insure the effectiveness of the devaluation by imposing new austerity<br/>measures on the nation, among them higher corporate taxes, a cutback in defense spending, and the<br/>highest bank rate in fifty years. As for the two-day delay in putting the devaluation into effect, which<br/>had been so costly to British reserves, officials now explained that the time had been necessary for<br/>conferences with the other leading monetary powers. Such conferences were required by international<br/>monetary rules before a devaluation, and, besides, Britain had urgently needed assurances from its<br/>leading competitors in world trade that they did not plan to vitiate the effect of the British devaluation<br/>with matching devaluations of their own. Some light was now shed, too, on the sources of the panic<br/>selling of pounds on Friday. By no means all of it had been wanton speculation by those famous—<br/>although invisible and perhaps nonexistent—gnomes of Zurich. On the contrary, much of it had been a<br/>form of self-protection, called hedging, by large international corporations, many of them American,<br/>that made short sales of sterling equivalent to what they were due to be paid in sterling weeks or<br/>months later. The evidence of this was supplied by the corporations themselves, some of them being<br/>quick to assure their stockholders that through their foresight they had contrived to lose little or<br/>nothing on the devaluation. International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, for example, announced on Sunday<br/>that the devaluation would not affect its 1967 earnings, because “management anticipated the<br/>possibility of devaluation for some time.” International Harvester and Texas Instruments reported that<br/>they had protected themselves by making what amounted to short sales of sterling. The Singer<br/>Company said it might even have accidentally made a profit on the deal. Other American companies<br/>let it be known that they had come out all right, but declined to elaborate, on the ground that if they<br/>revealed the methods they had used they might be accused of taking advantage of Britain in its<br/>extremity. “Let’s just say we were smart” was the way a spokesman for one company put it. And<br/>perhaps that, if lacking in grace and elegance, was fair enough. In the jungle of international business,<br/>hedging on a weak foreign currency is considered a wholly legitimate use of claws for self-defense.<br/>Selling short for speculative purposes enjoys less respectability, and it is interesting to note that the<br/>ranks of those who speculated against sterling on Friday, and talked about it afterward, included some<br/>who were far from Zurich. A group of professional men in Youngstown, Ohio—veteran stock-market<br/>players, but never before international currency plungers—decided on Friday that sterling was about<br/>to be devalued, and sold short seventy thousand pounds, netting a profit of almost twenty-five<br/>thousand dollars over the weekend. The pounds sold had, of course, ultimately been bought with<br/>dollars by the Bank of England, thus adding a minuscule drop to Britain’s reserve loss. Reading about<br/>the little coup in the </span></a><i>Wall Street Journal </i><span>, to which the group’s broker had reported it, presumably<br/>with pride, I hoped the apprentice gnomes of Youngstown had at least grasped the implications of<br/>what they were doing.</span><a name="bookmark403">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark404">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>So much for Sunday and moral speculation. On Monday, the financial world, or most of it, went<br/>back to work, and the devaluation began to be put to its test. The test consisted of two questions.<br/>Question One: Would the devaluation accomplish its purpose for Britain—that is, stimulate exports<br/>and reduce imports sufficiently to cure the international deficit and put an end to speculation against<br/>the pound? Question Two: Would it, as in 1931, be followed by a string of competitive devaluations<br/>of other currencies, leading ultimately to a devaluation of the dollar in relation to gold, worldwide<br/>monetary chaos, and perhaps a world depression? I watched the answers beginning to take shape.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On Monday, the banks and exchanges in London remained firmly closed, by government order, and<br/>all but a few traders elsewhere avoided taking positions in sterling in the Bank of England’s absence<br/>from the market, so the answer to the question of the pound’s strength or weakness at its new</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark405"><span>valuation was postponed; On Threadneedle and Throgmorton Streets, crowds of brokers, jobbers,<br/>and clerks milled around and talked excitedly—but made no trades—in a city where the Union Jack<br/>was flying from all flagstaffs because it happened to be the Queen’s wedding anniversary. The New<br/>York stock market opened sharply lower, then recovered. (There was no really rational explanation<br/>for the initial drop; securities men pointed out that devaluation just generally sounds depressing.) By<br/>nightfall on Monday, it had been announced that eleven other currencies—those of Spain, Denmark,<br/>Israel, Hong Kong, Malta, Guyana, Malawi, Jamaica, Fiji, Bermuda, and Ireland—were also being<br/>devalued. That wasn’t so bad, because the disruptive effect of a currency devaluation is in direct<br/>proportion to the importance of that currency in world trade, and none of those currencies were of<br/>great importance. The most ominous move was Denmark’s, because Denmark might easily be<br/>followed by its close economic allies Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, and that </span></a><i>would </i><span>be<br/>pretty serious. Egypt, which was an instant loser of thirty-eight million dollars on pounds held in its<br/>reserves at the time of devaluation, held firm, and so did Kuwait, which lost eighteen million.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On Tuesday, the markets everywhere were going full blast. The Bank of England, back in business,<br/>set the new trading limits of the pound at a floor of $2.38 and a ceiling of $2.42, whereupon the pound<br/>went straight to the ceiling, like a balloon slipped from a child’s hand, and stayed there all day;<br/>indeed, for obscure reasons inapplicable to balloons, it spent much of the day slightly above the<br/>ceiling. Now, instead of paying dollars for pounds, the Bank of England was supplying pounds for<br/>dollars, and thereby beginning the process of rebuilding its reserves. I called Waage to share what I<br/>thought would be his jubilation, but found him taking it all calmly. The pound’s strength, he said, was<br/>“technical”—that is, it was caused by the previous week’s short sellers’ buying pounds back to cash<br/>in their profits—and the first objective test of the new pound would not come until Friday. Seven<br/>more small governments announced devaluations during the day. In Malaysia, which had devalued its<br/>old sterling-backed pound but not its new dollar, based on gold, and which continued to keep both<br/>currencies in circulation, the injustice of the situation led to riots, and over the next two weeks more<br/>than twenty-seven people were killed in them—the first casualties of devaluation. Apart from this<br/>painful reminder that the counters in the engrossing game of international finance are people’s<br/>livelihoods, and even their lives, so far so good.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark406"><span>But on Wednesday the twenty-second a less localized portent of trouble appeared. The speculative<br/>attack that had so long battered and at last crushed the pound now turned, as everyone had feared it<br/>might, on the dollar. As the one nation that is committed to sell gold in any quantity to the central bank<br/>of any other nation at the fixed price of thirty-five dollars an ounce, the United States is the keystone<br/>of the world monetary arch, and the gold in its Treasury—which on that Wednesday amounted to not<br/>quite thirteen billion dollars’ worth—is the foundation. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Martin had<br/>said repeatedly that the United States would under any condition continue to sell it on demand, if<br/>necessary down to the last bar. Despite this pledge, and despite President Johnson’s reiteration of it<br/>immediately after Britain’s devaluation, speculators now began buying gold with dollars in huge<br/>quantities, expressing the same sort of skepticism toward official assurances that was shown at about<br/>the same time by New Yorkers who took to accumulating and hoarding subway tokens. Gold was<br/>suddenly in unusual demand in Paris, Zurich, and other financial centers, and most particularly in<br/>London, the world’s leading gold market, where people immediately began to talk about the London<br/>Gold Rush. The day’s orders for gold, which some authorities estimated at over fifty million dollars’<br/>worth, seemed to come in from everywhere—except, presumably, from citizens of the United States<br/>or Britain, who are forbidden by law to buy or own monetary gold. And who was to sell the stuff to<br/>these invisible multitudes so suddenly repossessed by the age-old lust for it? Not the United States</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Treasury, which, through the Federal Reserve, sold gold only to central banks, and not other central<br/>banks, which did not promise to sell it at all. To fill this vacuum, still another coöperative<br/>international group, the London gold pool, had been established in 1961. Provided by its members—<br/>the United States, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, West Germany, Belgium, and,<br/>originally, France—with gold ingots in quantities that might dazzle a Croesus (fifty-nine per cent of<br/>the total coming from the United States), the pool was intended to quell money panics by supplying<br/>gold to non-governmental buyers in any quantity demanded, at a price effectively the same as the<br/>Federal Reserve’s, and thereby to protect the stability of the dollar and the system.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark407"><span>And that is what the pool did on Wednesday. Thursday, though, was much worse, with the gold-<br/>buying frenzy in both Paris and London breaking even the records set during the Cuban missile crisis<br/>of 1962, and many people, high British and American officials among them, became convinced of<br/>something they had suspected from the first—that the gold rush was part of a plot by General de<br/>Gaulle and France to humble first the pound and now the dollar. The evidence, to be sure, was all<br/>circumstantial, but it was persuasive. De Gaulle and his Ministers had long been on record as<br/>wishing to relegate the pound and the dollar to international roles far smaller than their current ones.<br/>A suspicious amount of the gold buying, even in London, was traceable to France. On Monday<br/>evening, thirty-six hours before the start of the gold rush, France’s government had let slip, through a<br/>press leak, that it intended to withdraw from the gold pool (according to subsequent information,<br/>France hadn’t contributed anything to the pool since the previous June anyhow), and the French<br/>government was also accused of having had a hand in spreading false rumors that Belgium and Italy<br/>were about to withdraw, too. And now it was coming out, bit by bit, that in the days just before the<br/>devaluation France had been by far the most reluctant nation to join in another credit package to<br/>rescue sterling, and that, for good measure, France had withheld until the very last minute its<br/>assurance that it would maintain its own exchange rate if Britain devalued. All in all, there was a<br/>good case for the allegation that de Gaulle &amp; Co. had been playing a mischievous part, and, whether<br/>it was true or not, I couldn’t help feeling that the accusations against them were adding a good deal of<br/>spice to the devaluation crisis—spice that would become more piquant a few months later, when the<br/>franc would be in dire straits, and the United States forced by circumstances to come to its aid.</span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark408"><span class="s6">ON </span></a><span>Friday, in London, the pound spent the whole day tight up against its ceiling, and thus came<br/>through its first really significant post-devaluation test with colors flying. Only a few small<br/>governments had announced devaluations since Monday, and it was now evident that Norway,<br/>Sweden, and the Netherlands were going to hold firm. But on the dollar front things looked worse<br/>than ever. Friday’s gold buying in London and Paris had far exceeded the previous day’s record, and<br/>estimates were that gold sales in all markets over the preceding three days added up to something not<br/>far under the billion-dollar mark; there was near pandemonium all day in Johannesburg as speculators<br/>scrambled to get their hands on shares in gold-mining companies; and all over Europe people were<br/>trading in dollars not only for gold but for other currencies as well. If the dollar was hardly in the<br/>position that the pound had occupied a week earlier, at least there were uncomfortable parallels.<br/>Subsequently, it was reported that in the first days after devaluation the Federal Reserve, so<br/>accustomed to lending support to other currencies, had been forced to </span><i>borrow </i><span>various foreign<br/>currencies, amounting to almost two billion dollars’ worth, in order to defend its own.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Late Friday, having attended a conference at which Waage was in an unaccustomed mood of<br/>nervous jocularity that made me nervous, too, I left the Federal Reserve Bank half believing that<br/>devaluation of the dollar was going to be announced over the weekend. Nothing of the sort happened;</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark409"><span>on the contrary, the worst was temporarily over. On Sunday, it was announced that central-bank<br/>representativesof the gold-pool countries, Hayes and Coombs among them, had met in Frankfurt and<br/>formally agreed to continue maintaining the dollar at its present gold-exchange rate with their<br/>combined resources. This seemed to remove any doubt that the dollar was backed not only by the<br/>United States’ thirteen-billion-dollar gold hoard but also by the additional fourteen billion dollars’<br/>worth of gold in the coffers of Belgium, Britain, Italy, the Netherland, Switzerland, and West<br/>Germany. The speculators were apparently impressed. On Monday, gold buying was much lower in<br/>London and Zurich, continuing at a record pace only in Paris—and this in spite of a sulphurous press<br/>audience granted that day by de Gaulle himself, who, along with bemusing opinions on various other<br/>matters, hazarded the view that the trend of events was toward the decline of the dollar’s international<br/>importance. On Tuesday, gold sales dropped sharply everywhere, even in Paris. “A good day today,”<br/>Waage told me on the phone that afternoon. “A better day tomorrow, we hope.” On Wednesday, the<br/>gold markets were back to normal, but, as a result of the week’s doings, the Treasury had lost some<br/>four hundred and fifty tons of gold—almost half a billion dollars’ worth—in fulfilling its obligations<br/>to the gold pool and meeting the demands of foreign central banks.</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Ten days after devaluation, everything was quiet. But it was only a trough between succeeding<br/>shock waves. From December 8th to 18th, there came a new spell of wild speculation against the<br/>dollar, leaching another four hundred tons or so of gold out of the pool; this, like the previous wave,<br/>was eventually calmed by reiterations on the part of the United States and its gold-pool partners of<br/>their determination to maintain the status quo. By the end of the year, the Treasury had lost almost a<br/>billion dollars’ worth of gold since Britain’s devaluation, reducing its gold stock to below the<br/>twelve-billion-dollar mark for the first time since 1937. President Johnson’s balance-of-payments<br/>program, announced January 1st, 1968 and based chiefly on restrictions on American bank lending<br/>and industrial investments abroad, helped keep speculation down for two months. But the gold rush<br/>was not to be quelled so simply. All pledges notwithstanding, it had powerful economic and<br/>psychological forces behind it. In a larger sense, it was an expression of an age-old tendency to<br/>distrust all paper currencies in times of crisis, but more specifically it was the long-feared sequel to<br/>sterling devaluation, and—perhaps most specifically of all—it was a vote of no confidence in the<br/>determination of the United States to keep its economic affairs in order, with particular reference to a<br/>level of civilian consumption beyond the dreams of avarice at a time when ever-increasing billions<br/>were being sent abroad to support a war with no end in sight. The money in which the world was<br/>supposed to be putting its trust looked to the gold speculators like that of the most reckless and<br/>improvident spendthrift.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark410"><span>When they returned to the attack, on February 29th—choosing that day for no assignable reason<br/>except that a single United States senator, Jacob Javits, had just remarked, with either deadly<br/>seriousness or casual indiscretion, that he thought his country might do well to suspend temporarily<br/>all gold payments to foreign countries—it was with such ferocity that the situation quickly got out of<br/>hand. On March 1st, the gold pool dispensed an estimated forty to fifty tons in London (as against<br/>three or four tons on a normal day); on March 5th and 6th, forty tons per day; on March 8th, over<br/>seventy-five tons; and on March 13th, a total that could not be accurately estimated but ran well over<br/>one hundred tons. Meanwhile, the pound, which could not possibly escape a further devaluation if the<br/>dollar were to be devalued in relation to gold, slipped below its par of $2.40 for the first time. Still<br/>another reiteration of the now-familiar pledges, this time from the central-bankers’ club at Basel on<br/>March 10th, seemed to have no effect at all. The market was in the classic state of chaos, distrustful<br/>of every public assurance and at the mercy of every passing rumor. A leading Swiss banker grimly</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>called the situation “the most dangerous since 1931.” A member of the Basel club, tempering<br/>desperation with charity, said that the gold speculators apparently didn’t realize their actions were<br/>imperilling the world’s money. The New York </span><i>Times</i><span>, in an editorial, said, “It is quite clear that the<br/>international payments system … is eroding.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark411"><span>On Thursday, March 14th, panic was added to chaos. London gold dealers, in describing the day’s<br/>action, used the un-British words “stampede,” “catastrophe,” and “nightmare.” The exact volume of<br/>gold sold that day was unannounced, as usual—probably it could not have been precisely counted, in<br/>any case—but everyone agreed that it had been an all-time record; most estimates put the total at<br/>around two hundred tons, or two hundred and twenty million dollars’ worth, while the </span></a><i>Wall Street</i><span>put it twice that high. If the former estimate was right, during the trading day the United States<br/>Treasury had paid out through its share of the gold pool alone one million dollars in gold every three<br/>minutes and forty-two seconds; if the </span><i>Journal </i><span>figure was right (as a subsequent Treasury<br/>announcement made it appear to be), a million every </span><i>one </i>minute and <i>fifty-one </i><span>seconds. Clearly, this<br/>wouldn’t do. Like Britain in 1964, at this rate the United States would have a bare cupboard in a<br/>matter of days. That afternoon, the Federal Reserve System raised its discount rate from four and a<br/>half to five per cent—a defensive measure so timid and inadequate that one New York banker<br/>compared it to a popgun, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the System’s foreign-<br/>exchange arm, was moved to protest by refusing to go along with the token raise. Late in the day in<br/>New York, and toward midnight in London, the United States asked Britain to keep the gold market<br/>closed the next day, Friday, to prevent further catastrophe and clear the way to the weekend, when<br/>face-to-face international consultations could be held. The bewildered American public, largely<br/>unaware of the gold pool’s existence, probably first sensed the general shape of things when it<br/>learned on Friday morning that Queen Elizabeth II had met with her Ministers on the crisis between<br/>midnight and 1 </span><span class="s6">A.M.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>On Friday, a day of nervous waiting, the London markets were closed, and so were foreign-<br/>exchange desks nearly everywhere else, but gold shot up to a big premium in the Paris market—a sort<br/>of black market, from the American standpoint—and in New York sterling, unsupported by the firmly<br/>locked Bank of England, briefly fell below its official bottom price of $2.38 before rallying. Over the<br/>weekend, the central bankers of the gold-pool nations (the United States, Britain, West Germany,<br/>Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with France still conspicuously missing and,<br/>indeed, uninvited this time) met in Washington, with Coombs participating for the Federal Reserve<br/>along with Chairman Martin. After two full days of rigidly secret discussions, while the world of<br/>money waited with bated breath, they announced their decisions late on Sunday afternoon. The thirty-<br/>five-dollar-an-ounce official monetary price of gold would be kept for use in all dealings among<br/>central banks; the gold pool would be disbanded, and the central banks would supply no more gold to<br/>the London market, where privately traded gold would be allowed to find its own price; sanctions<br/>would be taken against any central bank seeking to profit from the price differential between the<br/>central-bank price and the free-market price; and the London gold market would remain closed for a<br/>couple of weeks, until the dust settled. During the first few market days under the new arrangements,<br/>the pound rallied strongly, and the free-market price of gold settled at between two and five dollars<br/>above the central-bank price—a differential considerably smaller than many had expected.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark412">The crisis had passed, or </a><i>that </i><span>crisis had. The dollar had escaped devaluation, and the international<br/>monetary mechanism was intact. Nor was the solution a particularly radical one; after all, gold had<br/>been on a two-price basis in 1960, before the gold pool had been formed. But the solution was a<br/>temporary, stopgap one, and the curtain was not down on the drama yet. Like Hamlet’s ghost, the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>pound, which had started the action, was offstage now. The principal actors onstage as summer<br/>approached were the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury, doing what they could in a<br/>technical way to keep things on an even keel; the Congress, complacent with prosperity, preoccupied<br/>with coming elections, and therefore resistant to higher taxes and other uncomfortable retrenching<br/>measures (on the very afternoon of the London panic, the Senate Finance Committee had voted down<br/>an income-tax surcharge); and, finally, the President, calling for “a program of national austerity” to<br/>defend the dollar, yet at the same time carrying on at ever-increasing expense the Vietnam war, which<br/>had become as menacing to the health of America’s money as, in the view of many, it was to that of<br/>America’s soul. Ultimately, it appeared, the nation had just three possible economic courses: to<br/>somehow end the Vietnam war, root of the payments problem and therefore heart of the matter; to<br/>adopt a full wartime economy, with sky-high taxes, wage and price controls, and perhaps rationing; or<br/>to face forced devaluation of the dollar and perhaps a depression-breeding world monetary mess.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark413"><span>Looking beyond the Vietnam war and its incredibly broad worldwide monetary implications, the<br/>central bankers went on plugging away. Two weeks after the stopgap solution of the dollar crisis,<br/>those of the ten most powerful industrial countries met in Stockholm and agreed, with only France<br/>dissenting, on the gradual creation of a new international monetary unit to supplement gold as the<br/>bedrock underlying all currencies. It will consist (if action follows on resolution) of special drawing<br/>rights on the International Monetary Fund, available to nations in proportion to their existing reserve<br/>holdings. In bankers’ jargon the rights will be called S.D.R.’s; in popular jargon they were at once<br/>called paper gold. The success of the plan in achieving its ends—averting dollar devaluation,<br/>overcoming the world shortage of monetary gold, and thus postponing indefinitely the threatened mess</span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>—will depend on whether or not men and nations can somehow at last, in a triumph of reason,<br/>achieve what they have failed to achieve in almost four centuries of paper money: that is, to overcome<br/>one of the oldest and least rational of human traits, the lust for the look and feel of gold itself, and<br/>come to give truly equal value to a pledge written on a piece of paper. The answer to that question<br/>will come in the last act, and the outlook for a happy ending is not bright.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AS <span class="p">the last act was beginning to unfold—after the sterling devaluation but before the gold panic—I<br/>went  down to Liberty Street and saw Coombs and Hayes. I found Coombs looking bone-tired but not<br/>sounding disheartened about three years spent largely in a losing cause. “I don’t see the fight for the<br/>pound as all having been in vain,” he said. “We gained those three years, and during that time the<br/>British put through a lot of internal measures to strengthen themselves. If they’d been forced to<br/>devalue in 1964, there’s a good chance that wage-and-price inflation would have eaten up any benefit<br/>they derived and put them back in the same old box. Also, over those three years there have been<br/>further gains in international monetary coöperation. Goodness knows what would have happened to<br/>the whole system with devaluation in 1964. Without that three-year international effort—that<br/>rearguard action, you might say—sterling might have collapsed in much greater disorder, with far<br/>more damaging repercussions than we’ve seen even now. Remember that, after all, our effort and the<br/>effort of the other central-banks wasn’t to hold up sterling for its own sake. It was to hold it up for the<br/>sake of preserving the system. And the system has survived.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark414"><span>Hayes, on the surface, seemed exactly as he had when I last saw him, a year and a half earlier—as<br/>placid and unruffled as if he had been spending all that time studying up on Corfu. I asked him<br/>whether he was still living up to his principle of keeping bankers’ hours, and he replied, smiling very<br/>slightly, that the principle had long since yielded to expediency—that, as a time consumer, the 1967<br/>sterling crisis had made the 1964 crisis seem like child’s play, and that the subsequent dollar crisis</span></a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>was turning out to be more of the same. A side benefit of the whole three-and-a-half-year affair, he<br/>said, was that its frequently excruciating melodrama  had contributed something to Mrs. Hayes’<br/>interest in banking, and even something, if not so much, to the position of business in Tom’s scale of<br/>values.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span>When Hayes spoke of the devaluation, however, I saw that his placidity was a mask. “Oh, I was<br/>disappointed, all right,” he said quietly. “After all, we worked like the devil to prevent it. And we<br/>nearly did. In my opinion, Britain could have got enough assistance from abroad to hold the rate. It<br/>could have been done without France. Britain chose to devalue. I think there’s a good chance that the<br/>devaluation will eventually be a success. And the gain for international coöperation is beyond<br/>question. Charlie Coombs and I could feel that at Frankfurt in November, at the gold-pool meeting—a<br/>sense everyone there had that now is the time to lock arms. But still …” Hayes paused, and when he<br/>spoke again his voice was full of such quiet force that I saw the devaluation through his eyes—not as<br/>just a severe professional reverse but as an ideal lost and an idol fallen. He said, “That day in<br/>November, here at the bank, when a courier brought me the top-secret British document informing us<br/>of the decision to devalue, I felt physically sick. Sterling would not be the same. It would never again<br/>command the same amount of faith around the world.”</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark415">Index</a><a name="bookmark416">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A.
